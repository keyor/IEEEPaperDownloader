A parametric DFM solution for analog circuits: Electrical driven hot spot detection, analysis and correction flow###As VLSI technology pushes into advanced nodes, designers and foundries have exposed a hitherto insignificant set of yield problems. To combat yield failures, the semiconductor industry has deployed new tools and methodologies commonly referred to as design for manufacturing (DFM). Most of the early efforts concentrated on catastrophic failures, or physical DFM problems. Recently, there has been an increased emphasis on parametric yield issues, referred to as electrical-DFM (e-DFM). In this paper, we present a complete electrical-aware design for manufacturing solution that detects, analyzes, and fixes electrical hotspots (e-hotspots) caused by different process variations within the analog circuit design. Novel algorithms are proposed to implement the engines that are used to develop this solution. Our proposed flow is examined on a 65nm industrial voltage control oscillator (VCO). E-hotspot devices with 5.5% variation in DC current are identified. After fixing the e-hotspots, the DC current variation in these devices is reduced to 0.9%, while saving the original VCO specifications.

A 144-configuration context MEMS optically reconfigurable gate array###Demand for space uses of FPGAs is increasing to support hardware repair and hardware update functions in addition to software repair and update functions in spacecraft, satellites, space stations, and other applications. However, under a space radiation environment, the incidence of high-energy charged particles causes single or multi-event latch-up (S/MEL)-associated troubles and single or multi-event upset (S/MEU)-associated temporary failures. Although an FPGA, because of its programmability, presents the advantageous capabilities of recovering from and updating after S/MEL-associated troubles, the FPGA can not guard itself completely from S/MEU-associated temporary failures that might arise on its configuration SRAM. This paper therefore presents a proposal for a 144-configuration context MEMS optically reconfigurable gate array that can support a remotely updatable hardware function, can quickly repair S/MEL-associated permanent failures, and can perfectly guard itself from S/MEU-associated temporary failures that can occur in a space radiation environment.

Monitor strategies for variability reduction considering correlation between power and timing variability###As CMOS technology scales, Process, Voltage and Temperature (PVT) variations have an increasing impact on, performance and power consumption of the electronic devices. Variability causes an undesirable dispersion of performance parameters and a consequent reduction in parametric yield.

This paper aims to determine which type of sensor provides a better overall variability reduction by taking into account the correlation between different performance magnitudes: static power, dynamic power and delay.

Transport Layer Assisted Routing for Non-Stationary Irregular mesh of thermal-aware 3D Network-on-Chip systems###Thermal issue is important for 3D Network-on-Chip systems. To ensure thermal safety, run-time thermal management is required. However, the regulation of temperature requires throttling of the near-overheated router, which makes the topology become Non-Stationary Irregular mesh (NSI-mesh). To successfully deliver packet in NSI-mesh, we propose the Transport Layer Assisted Routing (TLAR) scheme and two algorithms for thermal-aware 3D NoC. Based on the experimental results, the proposed routing scheme can reduce the latency over 57.5% and improve the throughput above 1.47&#x00D7;.

TSV-based 3D-IC placement for timing optimization###The semiconductor technology continue its advnacement in 3D-IC circuit. The concept of 3D-IC introduces additional dimension in latest designs by using stack structures with through-silicon via (TSV). 3D ICs replace long interconnect in 2D ICs with TSV cells. However, optimization in terms of 3DIC is still immature in many aspects. There still exist problems in placement of standard cells and TSV cells in terms of timing optimization. In this paper, we proposed a methodology on cell placement by applying min-cut partitioning in one layer after layer assignment and address alignment constraint simultaneously. We applied Simulated Annealing to optimize timing and wirelength reduction. In final stage, a greedy legalization procedure is implemented to remove operlaps between cells and TSV cells. Experimental results show that both the wirelengths and the delay of critical paths in 3DICs are much superior compare to 2D ICs.

Multi-Pheromone ACO-based routing in Network-on-Chip system inspired by economic phenomenon###Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a collective intelligence problem-solving paradigm. By ACO, we can effectively distribute the central control unit to achieve higher performance. With the scaling of Network-on-Chip (NoC) size, more complex communication problems can severely harm the system performance. Therefore, we need more efficient ACO-adaptive routing to achieve better trend prediction for global load-balancing. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Pheromone ACO-based (MPACO) routing to make better use of the network information and provide a deeper look to the local model. By adopting the concept of Exponential Moving Average (EMA) in stock market, MPACO provide additional dimension aspect: rate of change in network information by laying pheromone with different evaporation speed. The experimental results show that MPACO can achieve higher performance while maintaining similar implementation cost compared to the previous work.

TSV sharing through multiplexing for TSV count minimization in high-level synthesis###TSV count minimization is an important topic for 3D ICs. In previous works, TSV sharing is limited to the same functional unit output and the same functional unit input. In this paper, we present the first attempt to use multiplexers to extend TSV sharing for cross-layer data transfers that have different functional unit outputs and different functional unit inputs. We use an ILP (integer linear programming) to formally draw up the simultaneous application of resource binding, layer assignment, and TSV sharing (through multiplexing) to minimize the TSV count. Compared with previous works, our approach can greatly further reduce the TSV count.

Yield-award placement optimization for Switched-Capacitor analog integrated circuits###Paralleling square unit capacitors have been commonly used for Switched-Capacitor circuits to achieve higher accurate capacitor ratio. However, the capacitor ratio may be shifted due to the wire interconnection of these unit capacitors. The small capacitor ratio shift may cause a significant yield drop. The ratio shift can be reduced by using extra circuitry to achieve parasitic insensitive design. This study presents a simple a layout modification to alleviate the ratio shift, thus enhancing yield, without requiring extra circuitry.

An analytical model to estimate PCM failure probability due to process variations###Phase change memory (PCM) features nonvolatility, high density, and superior power efficiency, making it one of the most promising candidates for future memory systems. This paper studies the impact of process variations on PCM based on a fast analytical model for determining PCM failure probability. The proposed analytical model takes PCM physical dimensions, programming-current amplitude, and programming duration as inputs and produces the corresponding cell resistance. Whether a PCM cell is functional can be determined by comparing the calculated cell resistance with the reference resistance. We further estimate the overall PCM failure probability and demonstrate strategies on how to minimize memory failures. The proposed model thus provides early stage estimation on memory yield.

&#x201C;Post silicon debug of SOC designs&#x201D;###Continuous advances in VLSI technology have made implementation of very complicated systems possible. Modern System-on -Chips (SoCs) have many processors, IP cores and other functional units. As a result, complete verification of whole systems before implementation is becoming infeasible; hence it is likely that these systems may have some errors after manufacturing. This increases the need to find design errors in chips after fabrication. The main challenge for post-silicon debug is the observability of the internal signals. Post-silicon debug is the problem of determining what's wrong when the fabricated chip of a new design behaves incorrectly. This problem now consumes over half of the overall verification effort on large designs, and the problem is growing worse.Traditional post-silicon debug methods concentrate on functional parts of systems and provide mechanisms to increase the observability of internal state of systems. Those methods may not be sufficient as modern SoCs have lots of blocks (processors, IP cores, etc.) which are communicating with one another and communication is another source of design errors. This tutorial will be provide an insight into various observability enhancement techniques, on chip instrumentation techniques and use of high level models to support the debug process targeting both inside blocks and communication among them. It will also cover the use of formal methods to help debug process.

Recent research and emerging challenges in design and optimization for digital microfluidic biochips###Advances in droplet-based digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have led to the emergence of biochips for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry and molecular biology. These devices enable the precise control of microliter of nanoliter volumes of biochemical samples and reagents. They combine electronics with biology, and integrate various bioassay operations, such as sample preparation, analysis, separation, and detection. To meet the challenges of increasing design complexity, computer-aided-design (CAD) tools have been involved to build DMFBs efficiently. This paper provides an overview of DMFBs and describes emerging CAD tools for the automated synthesis and optimization of DMFB designs, from fluidic-level synthesis to chip-level design. Design automations are expected to relieve the design burden of manual optimization of bioassays, time-consuming chip designs, and costly testing and maintenance procedures. With the assistance of CAD tools, users can concentrate on the development and abstraction of nanoscale bioassays while leaving chip optimization and implementation details to CAD tools.

Recent research and emerging challenges in the System-Level Design of digital microfluidic biochips###Microfluidic biochips are replacing the conventional biochemical analyzers, and are able to integrate on-chip all the basic functions for biochemical analysis. The &#x201C;digital&#x201D; biochips are manipulating liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets on a two-dimensional array of electrodes. Basic microfluidic operations, such as mixing and dilution, are performed on the array, by routing the corresponding droplets on a series of electrodes. The challenges facing biochips are similar to those faced by microelectronics some decades ago. Computer-Aided Design tools for microfluidics are in their infancy, and designers are currently using manual, bottom-up design approaches to implement such biochips. Considering their architecture and the design tasks that have to be performed, the design of digital biochips has similarities to the high-level synthesis of integrated circuits. Motivated by this similarity, a few researchers have recently started to propose approaches for the top-down design of biochips. So far, they have assumed that operations are executing on virtual modules of rectangular shape, formed by grouping adjacent electrodes, and which have a fixed placement on the array. However, operations can actually execute by routing the droplets on any sequence of electrodes on the biochip. In this paper, we outline the original module-based synthesis problem, and then we present recent work which eliminates the concept of virtual modules and allows droplets to move on the chip on any route during operation execution. We discuss the advantages of such an approach, and identify the challenges and opportunities of system-level design of digital microfluidic biochips.

We rapidly characterized the required power models by using physical power measurement to construct the ESL power estimation environment. According to the experimental results, using the proposed framework can have quite accurate power estimation and correct power trend prediction in different voltage/frequency conditions. We also had demonstrated that the low power methodologies can be analyzed and simulated based on this framework.

A CAD methodology for automatic topology selection &amp; sizing###Over the years, as system on chip is increasingly incorporating analog functionalities, there is a need of a tool, which can automate the analog topology selection and sizing flow. We develop one efficient methodology to automatically select the best topology given only the user specifications. The proposed topology selection is a multilevel screening process inherited from geometric programming (GP) by sequentially introducing sub-sets of requirements. This helps to prune out unfit topologies at early stage and hence not costing much computational effort. Use of GP ensures fast convergence with optimal solution. Apart from the speed advantage, compared to the existing literature, methodology has better representation of topology performance expressions. We propose to use two levels of performance expressions. First one is technology independent and the second one is technology specific. This bifurcation of performance expressions help in quick technology migration. Third contribution is automatic node expression generation which are required for dc performance evaluation. The proposed methodology is used for selecting optimal error amplifier topology for low dropout regulator (LDO).

An energy-efficient 10T SRAM-based FIFO memory operating in near-/sub-threshold regions###In this paper, an ultra-low power (ULP) 16Kb SRAM-based first-in first-out (FIFO) memory is proposed for wireless body area networks (WBANs).

CGA: Combining cluster analysis with genetic algorithm for regression suite reduction of microprocessors###Regression testing plays an important role in the simulation-based functional verification of microprocessors. Regression suite is maintained in the entire verification phase with an increase of the scale. However, the executing cost is always high when running the entire suite on a RTL-level simulator. Regression suite reduction (called RSR for short) is presented to reduce the executing cost of the regression suite without debasing the quality of the functional verification. For this two-objective RSR of microprocessors, we present a heuristic algorithm which mainly combines cluster analysis with genetic algorithm (called CGA for short). The experiments on some regression suites at different scales for a microprocessor have shown the efficiency and feasibility of CGA. CGA can effectively reduce about 90% of the executing cost without decreasing the functional coverage in an acceptable runtime.

Opposed to existing work, both schemes reach almost absolute fairness of link bandwidth allocation and simplify calculation of arbitration metrics.

A novel approach to estimate the impact of analog circuit performance based on the small signal model under process variations###Continuous scaling in CMOS fabrication process makes integrated circuits more vulnerable to process variations. The impact on circuit performance caused by process variations in CMOS circuit is usually analyzed by Monte Carlo method with a large number of simulation runs. This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate the impact of analog circuit performance based on the small signal model under process variations. The accuracy of the small signal model has been verified with CMOS circuit. The proposed approach has been demonstrated by a CMOS two-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). To achieve an accurate estimate, the modified small signal model which consider more parasitic capacitors in CMOS transistor, has been applied in the proposed approach. By applying the proposed approach based on optimization method, the upper and lower bounds of magnitude and phase, can be evaluated accurately in much less computation time compared to Monte Carlo simulations. All experimental results are carried out using a standard 0.35-&#x03BC;m CMOS process technology.

Phase Change Memory (PCM) technology has been explored for decades, yet today it is looming on the verge of market impact. Commercially available today for very specific applications, the full scope of value remains to be realized, or even defined. PCM offers unique capabilities and features not seen in any other commercial memory or storage technology, yet its immaturity in a well established marketplace makes adoption in the server space challenging. Full utilization will depend not only upon advancements in PCM density and improvements in performance, but also more fundamental changes in the age old DRAM to disk hierarchy and adoption of a new paradigm in how system architecture is approached - technology/system/application co-development. In the age of systems optimized for specific workloads, truly exploiting the value of PCM will depend upon optimizations being made across the entire system stack, from the technology itself, to the system architecture, and in the software stack.

Technology trends and implications on SoC design###Semiconductor technology evolution is increasingly driven by disruptive innovations rather than classical 2D scaling. These innovations, and potential new technologies such as 3D integration, will allow device counts to continue to increase well beyond the 1 - 2 billion of today's chips. With this ongoing growth in available devices the challenges in design quality and productivity will also grow, along with the investments needed for technology development and manufacturing. The challenges for chip and system designs lie in finding affordable means to harness these capabilities to deliver significant system level value to end users. In this presentation I will explore several of these technology trends, in the context of SoC design for high-performance systems, and describe several of the initiatives underway in IBM Research to address them.

A single-phase energy metering SoC with IAS-DSP and ultra low power metering mode###A single-phase energy metering SoC in TSMC 0.25um mixed-mode embedded FLASH technology is designed. While integrating four channel sigma-delta ADCs, PLL, oscillation circuit, regulators, temperature sensor, 8-bit CPU core, 32K byte FLASH memory, 1K byte SRAM memory, energy metering engine, and various on-chip peripherals, a small die size is achieved due to the implement of an 32-bit fixed-point Instruction and Architecture Specific DSP (IAS-DSP) to conduct the carefully designed multi-rate energy metering algorithm. To satisfy critical power restrictive applications, several ultra low power metering modes are designed. With these modes and the IAS-DSP, there is only about 100uA current dissipation while metering accuracy still meets industrial standards. The experimental results also prove excellent EMI rejection features. The chip is currently in production and millions has been shipped.

Software defined radio based frequency domain chaotic cognitive radio###Chaotic communication system has attracted strong interests in high security communication due to robustness in multi-path fading environments, resistance to jamming, and low probability of interception. Recently, cognitive radio has emerged as a strong candidate to solve the spectrum congestion problem by operating over under utilized spectrum bands. Hence, it is highly desired to combine the security advantages of chaos communication with cognitive radio to create a chaotic cognitive radio communication system. However, traditional chaotic communication system is based on time-domain chaotic signal generator where the signal occupies one wide contiguous frequency band, making it inappropriate for cognitive radio applications. To apply the chaotic sequence onto cognitive radio to take advantage of multiple spectrum bands, we generate the chaotic signal in frequency domain. By applying a spectrum mask onto the chaotic signal in frequency-domain, a frequency domain non-contiguous chaotic waveform is created. In this paper, we use universal software radio peripheral and GNU radio software to implement and demonstrate a frequency domain chaotic cognitive radio. This demonstration has several unique features: (1) supporting real-time video transmission; (2) taking advantage of multiple non-contiguous spectrum bands; (3) dynamic cognitive radio waveform adaptation according to the primary user transmissions; (4) maintaining the security features of chaotic communication.

A novel methodology for Multi-Project System-on-a-Chip###In this paper, a novel silicon prototyping methodology is presented for Multi-Project System-on-a-Chip (MP-SoC) implementation. For integrating heterogeneous SoC projects into a single chip, the current SoC methodology is insufficient due to the complexity of MP-SoC. In order to improve the robustness of MP-SoC design and verification, a new design flow was developed. It consists of a virtual platform, a logical implementation, a rapid prototyping platform, a physical implementation, and testing stages. The virtual platform is a system modeling and hardware/software co-design system by using electronic system level (ESL). VIP system is adopted for the AMBA-compliant check of the interfaces of the MP-SoC. In addition, STEAC and DFT were used to facilitate MP-SoC testing integration. The rapid prototyping platform called &#x201C;CONCORD&#x201D; which has characteristics of connection flexibility, modularization, and consistence architecture for emulating the hardware of MP-SoC before chip being taped out. The total silicon prototyping cost of these projects can be greatly reduced by sharing a common platform. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a MP-SoC chip was implemented with ten SoC projects sharing the common platform. The total silicon area is about 37.97mm<sup>2</sup> in the TSMC 0.13um CMOS generic logic process technology. Compared with the total chip area 129.39mm<sup>2</sup> by implementing these projects separately, the results show that there are 91.42 mm<sup>2</sup> or 70.6 % silicon area reduced by this novel silicon prototyping methodology.

In this paper, an on-demand memory sub-system is presented to efficiently control the memory access and memory resource allocation using adaptively allocated cache memory. The proposed adaptively allocated cache memory can dynamically assign a variable number of SRAM banks for process elements (PEs) to optimize the utilization of the centralized on-chip cache. In a wireless video entertainment system, a 7.13% execution time reduction and 10.53% energy reduction of memories can be achieved using the adaptively allocated cache memory.

This paper proposes a novel solution to reduce the signal feed-through problem commonly encountered in current mode digital-to-analog converters in pre-emphasis circuits. To improve the eye opening, the circuit must be able to limit the flow of feed-through signal to the summing node. The proposed multi-tap pre-emphasis circuit has been simulated using an IBM 130nm CMOS technology.

Feasibility study for communication over Power Distribution Networks of microprocessors###In this paper, we explore use of the Power Distribution Network (PDN) of a microprocessor as a communication channel for testing, debug, and diagnosis purposes. Feasibility of the proposed communication method is studied through direct measurements of microprocessor PDNs. Decoupling capacitors attached to the package make the PDN a low pass filter. However, the parasitic inductance of a decoupling capacitor becomes more significant beyond the self-resonant frequency, and our measurements on Intel microprocessor PDNs indicate that pass bands exist at frequencies beyond several 100 MHz. Impulse ultra wideband signals are a good candidate for communications over PDNs.

Keynote speaker###Summary form only given. SoCC started out as the IEEE ASIC Conference, moved to ASIC/SOC, and then to its current title SoCC. As the number of transistors on a chip has increased, designers have found it useful to include, in addition to the processor, a lot of system stuff that is in many ways orthogonal to the processor. We will soon reach the point where each chip will contain 50 billion transistors. Even after we take into account all the system stuff, there will still be a huge number of transistors available for our use. How do we harness them? The trend so far has been to increase the number of processor cores? I submit that there is a better way: the return of the ASIC. In this talk I will discuss why the ASIC will be particularly important for the microprocessor of 2020, and what we must do differently between now and then if we are to effectively exploit ASICs to the benefit of high performance chips.

Programmers can easily observe the power consumption during the application development stage. The power modeling is compared with Synopsys PrimeTime PX, and the maximum deviation is less than 4% by executing the BDTI benchmarks. Furthermore, we also discuss the power consumption of the PAC Duo multimedia platform.

Low voltage SRAMs and the scalability of the 9T Supply Feedback SRAM###Recent research has shown that minimum energy operation of digital circuits is in the sub-threshold region, and a good trade-off between power and performance can be achieved through operation at near threshold supply voltages. However, due to process variations and device mismatch at nanoscale technology nodes, voltage scaling of standard SRAMs is limited to strong-inversion operation. One of the techniques for enabling operation at low voltages is implementation of a Supply Feedback mechanism that internally weakens the pull-up current during write operations. This concept was recently implemented in a 9T Supply Feedback SRAM (SF-SRAM) cell, fabricated and successfully tested in a 40nm CMOS technology. In this paper, we review existing low voltage SRAM solutions, overview the SF-SRAM cell, and show its scalability into deep nanoscale technologies by using the 22nm predictive model.

Baseband signal processing in SDR###Wireless communications free users from being attached to wires and allow them to remain connected even when they move around at home or are on the road. Services that support high throughput yet cost little or even nothing are attractive to the consumers. Today, Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology makes up the foundation of 3G cellular system and Global Positioning System (GPS). Many other wireless standards are based on multi-carrier modulation technology (specifically OFDM). Multi-carrier modulation technology enjoys flexible spectral resource allocation and management as well as easy equalization. On the other hand, antenna array and spatial MIMO processing, which have been around for several decades, can provide spatial diversity gain and/or channel capacity increase. The application of the MIMO technology to wireless communications takes place only recently, exemplified by its adoption in IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e, and 3GPP LTE. In this talk I will address the above three important baseband technologies using insightful illustrations. In addition, I will give a design example using our previous work on software GPS receiver.

Configurable workload generators for multicore architectures###Proposed multicore architectures are usually evaluated using two types of benchmarks: application and synthetic. Application benchmarks use well understood computations to generate well defined workloads. In contrast, synthetic benchmarks are tunable to generate a range of custom workloads. Both classes are currently limited. Existing application benchmarks are inflexible. And the options offered by synthetic benchmarks are too limited to generate a large variety of workload patterns. In this paper we propose novel workload generation methodologies that allow system developers to generate custom benchmarks for desired workload conditions for a variety of existing and multicore architectures. Specifically we describe two configurable workload generators, which we name ConWork and CompWork. ConWork is a configurable synthetic workload generator using which artificial traffic among the processors and memories can be generated. CompWork is a configurable computational workload generator, which can be used to specify vector and matrix applications so as to elicit the desired computational workloads among the processors. Together the two generators provide a number of options to generate workloads to evaluate a variety of performance metrics of existing and emerging multicore architectures including bus based SoCs, packet switching NoCs and hybrids.

It is shown that 1) the minimum operation voltage (V<sub>DDmin</sub>) of a circuit is dominated by FFs, and it can be improved by appropriate transistor sizing, 2) V<sub>DDmin</sub> of a FF is stochastically modeled by a log-normal distribution, 3) V<sub>DDmin</sub> of a large circuit can be estimated using the above model without extensive Monte-Carlo simulations, and 4) improving V<sub>DDmin</sub> may substantially contribute to reduce energy consumption.

To reduce the power overhead, an open-loop delay line based phase shifter with a continuous locking scheme is adopted for the PM design. This design is implemented by 90 nm CMOS technology with active area of 0.1892 mm<sup>2</sup>. The PM provides 8-bit resolution with RMS error 0.33&#x00B0; at IF frequency 80 MHz, and the power consumption is only 885 uW with 1.0 V supply voltage. Considering a 64-QAM OFDM system, the EVM of -31.87 dB can be achieved by using the proposed PM pair.

A compact delay-recycled clock skew-compensation and/or duty-cycle-correction circuit###A clock skew-compensation and/or duty-cycle-correction circuit (CSADC) is indispensably required to maximize the performance of a synchronous double edge clocking system. Most conventional CSADCs adopted a cascade structure that inherits a lower performance property so as to slower the locking procedure, meanwhile the dual loop design results in more design complexity. A compact delay-recycled CSADC is proposed in this work. Compared to conventional CSADCs, the proposed circuit achieves at least a 2.5 times reduction in lock-in cycles, a 5.49 times reduction in power, and a 3.67 times reduction in power bandwidth ratio.

Integration of code optimization and hardware exploration for a VLIW architecture by using fuzzy control system###The Synchronous Transfer Architecture is a low power architecture of VLIW processor, which enables the direct data routing through buffered output ports of functional units. To improve the system efficiency of STA, in this paper we propose a novel approach to integrate compiler techniques with architecture exploration: A fuzzy control system is implemented to help the compiler back-end determine the optimal configuration of the STA processor and the corresponding target VLIW for different applications. This approach achieves the integration of the optimizations of code generation and hardware design. According to our studies, the drop in execution time is between 18% and 43% compared to the compiled ARM assembly code. Up to 42.4% register read and 67.9% register write operations are cut down on average. Except for reding the input data and writing back the results, all the other memory accesses for ARM architecture are avoided, giving us a dramatic reduction in the power consumption. Finally, the novel approach enjoys short compilation time and less complex implementation.

To avoid increasing the implementation hardware overhead, the proposed technique employs a clock-combined unit to generate the body voltage of keeper. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in a two-cycle 64-entries&#x00D7;32 b register file design for 8 GHz operation in 1V, 32 nm high-K Metal-Gate technology. HSPICE simulation results show that the delay time is reduced by 29% and the power consumption is reduced by 36.1%-46.2% depending on the number of reading ports, as compared to the tradition register files design. Moreover, the proposed technique shows good robustness to noise and process variations.

A gate sizing method for glitch power reduction###Due to the difficulty in estimating dynamic power at the gate level, a quantity called power metric and its efficient calculation method are introduced in this work. Based on the proposed power metric, a heuristic gate sizing algorithm for glitch power reduction is proposed for semi-custom design. The proposed heuristic algorithm minimizes the total power metric of a circuit. According to the experimental results on 8 ISCAS85 benchmark circuits and 5 real industrial circuits, more than 30% average glitch power reduction and 15.5% average total power reduction can be achieved by means of the proposed algorithm, respectively. The achieved improvements on power and area both are more than those by means of conventional gate sizing algorithms.

A multi-segment clocking scheme to reduce on-chip EMI###This paper presents an EMI reduction technique for VLSI circuits in which a multi-segment clock is employed. It is proven that utilizing a clock signal with relaxed edge rate can suppress the harmonic tones at the output spectrum. However, it calls for higher short-circuit power dissipation in the clocked devices. Proposed multi-segment clock signal reduces the electromagnetic radiations while keeping the short circuit power dissipation in an acceptable level. Simulation results in 65-nm CMOS process are presented to prove the capability of such a clock network in EMI reduction.

The reason to force this development is the increasing number of system-on-chip applications which require hard real-time or even cycle accurate execution of parallel tasks. Benchmarks show that the core presented in this work overcomes these barriers by implementing a well defined instruction set and an execution pipeline which allows fine-grain temporal multithreading.

An analog gamma correction method for high dynamic range applications###In this paper, a flexible analog gamma correction technology has been proposed. In order to represent images on modern display systems with proper contrast, gamma correction is required to encode these input images. Conventional gamma corrections are performed in the digital domain. However, due to the limitation of the ADC resolution, the image quality with low level luminance is significantly degraded. In this proposed method, the adjustment of the implementation for the gamma correction in a design flow integrates this image processing with A/D conversion at the same time. By this approach, the quantization noise of the ADC is not amplified by gamma correction. Furthermore, the hardware area and power consumption can be reduced.

HoneyComb: A multi-grained dynamically reconfigurable runtime adaptive hardware architecture###Reconfigurable computing is a promising concept for data processing. Higher parallel utilization of the given hardware resources results in better performance and lower power consumption compared to conventional approaches like von Neumann or Harvard architectures. Nevertheless, current reconfigurable solutions have their limitations and require more scientific attention. This contribution presents a new reconfigurable architecture which targets many weaknesses like array utilization, reusability and post-compile flexibility. Therefore, new features like runtime routing, multi-grained data types, partial reconfiguration and application tailored adaptability have been implemented and tightly coupled to software tools and programming languages. A demonstration chip using TSMC 90 nm standard cell technology has been designed and is currently in production.

De-Cache: A novel caching scheme for large-scale NoC based multiprocessor systems-on-chips###Multi-level caches are used in multiprocessor systems to exploit locality of data and decrease the bandwidth demands on the network. Apart from exploiting locality in large-scale networks, we must also amortize the cost of distant communication so as to reduce memory request latency which is a critical determinant of multiprocessor performance. Our proposed architecture called the De-Cache ($De) architecture exploits the nature of the network-on-chip (NoC) structure by introducing what we called detour caches to store data from the most distant physical memory locations closer to the requesting node. Our experiments show that by using our proposed $De architecture we can decrease the memory request latency up to approximately 29.0% with very little degradation to the network performance.

Computation and communication aware run-time mapping for NoC-based MPSoC platforms###Design-time strategies are suited only for mapping predefined set of applications and thus cannot predict dynamic behavior incurred due to the target applications and state of the platform at run-time. This dynamism demands run-time mapping of application tasks to maintain a critical balance between performance and resource optimization. Any disturbance may either lead to digression from expected performance or complete drain of valuable resources. So, it becomes mandatory to devise algorithms which can intelligently distribute the application tasks among processors taking communication overhead, computation load and resource utilization in consideration. This paper proposes a heuristic that illustrates how to incorporate these factors for mapping multiple tasks onto MPSoC platforms, where communication takes place through a Network-on-Chip. The heuristic attempts to balance the processing load on the platform processing elements (PEs) while reducing communication overhead by mapping highly communicating tasks on the same PE. For MPEG-4 application, the proposed technique reduces total execution time by 33%, resource usage by 37% and energy consumption by 40% when compared to state-of-the-art run-time mapping techniques.

Efficient design and synthesis of decimation filters for wideband delta-sigma ADCs###A design methodology for synthesizing power-optimized decimation filters for wideband Delta Sigma (&#x0394;&#x03A3;) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for next-generation wireless standards is presented. The decimation filter is designed to filter the out-of-band quantization noise from a fifth-order continuous-time &#x0394;&#x03A3; modulator, with 20 MHz signal bandwidth and 14-bits resolution. The modulator employs an oversampling ratio (OSR) of 16 with a clock rate of 640 MHz. Retiming, pipelining, Canonical Signed Digits (CSD) encoding has been utilized along with an optimized halfband filter to realize the power savings in the overall decimation filter. A process flow to rapidly design the optimized filters in MATLAB, generate the hardware description language (HDL) code and then automatically synthesize the design using standard cells has been presented. The decimation filter is implemented using standard cells in a 45 nm CMOS technology occupies a layout area of 0.12 mm<sup>2</sup> and consumes 8 mW power from the 1.1 V supply.

A current bleeding mixer based on Gilbert-cell featuring LO amplification###A high gain and low noise mixer based on current bleeding topology is implemented. The high performance is attributed to the effect of current injection and local oscillator (LO) amplification. The conversion gain of the mixer is 17.5 dB at -14 dBm LO power and the noise figure is 10.5 dB. The proposed topology dramatically relieves the typically high power requirement of LO. The mixer is implemented by a 0.18-Â¿m CMOS process. The operating frequency is 2.4 GHz with 10 MHz intermediate frequency. The circuit drains 12 mA current from a 1.5 V supply voltage.

A linearized low-voltage oscillator-mixer###In this paper, we propose a current bleeding oscillator-mixer. This circuit reuses the bleeding current, which relaxes mixer design trade-offs noise, linearity and gain at low supply voltages, by replacing the bleed current source as an oscillator. The linearized merged oscillator-mixer achieves a 8 dB gain, -3 dBV IIP3 and 6.2 dB white noise figure at the 7 GHz frequency. The phase-noise of the oscillator is -98 dBc/Hz at the 1 MHz offset from the 7Ghz LO frequency. The combined circuit consumes 5 mA from a 1.2 V supply.

When does Network-on-Chip bypassing make sense?###Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) are becoming widespread in contemporary multi-core and many-core designs. Amongst their appeals are regularity of layout and flexibility of topology. However, the energy consumed by routing nodes is now vastly more than that of an ALU operation in one of the processing cores they service. We present an evaluation of bypassing, a technique where selected traffic can avoid the full routing functionality of selected nodes in a NoC. When implemented correctly, bypassing can dramatically reduce the overall energy consumption of data flowing through the network. We address the questions of when bypassing should be deployed at a given node, how much energy will be saved by doing so, and present some equations to quantify and answer these questions. We show that if 74-80% of data, depending on router implementation, is destined for a node further away than that employing bypassing, then bypassing is energy-effective. Using these figures, we define guidelines for the use of bypassing for a wide variety of NoC designs.

In this paper, we present a hardware implementation of the regulator. We discuss its microarchitecture. Based on this microarchitecture, we design, implement and synthesize a multi-flow regulator for AXI. Our experiments show the effectiveness of such a regulation device on the control of delay, jitter and buffer requirements.

Power optimal Network-on-Chip interconnect design###A large part of today's multi-core chips is interconnect. Increasing communication complexity has made essential new strategies for interconnects, such as network on chip. Power dissipation in interconnects has become a substantial part of the total power dissipation. Techniques to reduce interconnect power have thus become a necessity. In this paper, we present a design methodology that gives values of bus width for interconnect links, frequency of operation for routers, in Network on Chip scenario that satisfy required throughput and dissipate minimal switching power. We develop closed form analytical expressions for the power dissipation, with bus width and frequency as variables and then use Lagrange multiplier method to arrive at the optimal values. We present a 4 port router in 90 nm technology library as case study. The results obtained from analysis are discussed.

High-speed, energy-efficient 2-cycle Multiply-Accumulate architecture###We propose a high-speed and energy-efficient 2-cycle multiply-accumulate (MAC) architecture. Our architecture is based on two's complement representation, it uses guarding bits to efficiently support longer MAC loops, and it includes output saturation. By performing carry propagation only in the second stage of the MAC pipeline, multiplication and accumulation have similar delays. But in contrast to previous MAC architectures that propose to only use one carry-propagation stage, our architecture requires no extra cycles to produce the final result. Instead it correctly produces the sum of the accumulated value and the product in each cycle.

Efficient runtime performance monitoring of FPGA-based applications###Embedded computing platforms have long incorporated non-traditional architectures (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) to combat the diminishing returns of Moore's Law as applied to traditional processors. These specialized architectures can offer higher performance potential in a smaller space, higher power efficiency, and competitive costs.

A 2.1-mW 0.3V-1.0V wide locking range multiphase DLL using self-estimated SAR algorithm###This paper presents an all-digital multiphase delay-locked loop (ADMDLL) for wide-locking range and micro-power applications. To enhance locking range of the ADMDLL, we proposed the self-estimated successive approximation register-controlled (SESAR) algorithm, which uses the frequency-estimation selector (FES) to avoid harmonic lock issue. In addition, the FES can reuse the delay line to reduce circuit area and power dissipation significantly. By using the stack effect, the proposed leakage-reduced delay unit can save 12% leakage power consumption. After locking, the dynamic frequency monitor window is proposed to compensation phase error caused by PVT variations. The proposed ADMDLL is capable of operating in wide supply voltage range from 0.3V to 1.0V. The power dissipation is only 520Â¿W at 1.25GHz/1.0V, and 2.1 Â¿W at 13MHz/0.3V, respectively.

A fully digital power supply noise thermometer###Power supply noise (PSN) is one of the main concerns in scaled technology circuits, both if performance reliability must be assured and if power supply is to be dynamically reduced for dissipation regulation. In this paper we propose a new system for digitally sensing power supply and ground levels that can be both transferred to the output for verification purposes and used by a control block within the circuit under test (CUT) for the activation of power aware policies. The sensor system shows very low overhead in terms of power and area, and works at the nominal CUT frequency. It allows to change on-site the power supply and ground ranges to be sensed and, after a fine tuning, can be arranged for a process variation aware measures. This sensor is fully digital and standard cell based and can be used for every type of architecture on a systematic basis for PSN measure as scan chains are for fault verification. It thus represents a change of paradigm in the way in which PSN measure systems are thought nowadays.

The double scroll attractor is modeled on Chua's circuit for nonlinear operation leading to double scroll chaotic behavior. The output from the chaotic circuit which is a correlated binary sequence is scrambled with a pseudo random binary sequence generator (PRBSG) topology to yield a true random binary source for key stream generation. The modified chaotic circuit has been implemented on printed circuit board (PCB) along with a field programmable gate array (FPGA) for true random bits generation. The randomness attributes of the hardware generator construction, using the PRBSG de-correlator were successfully tested by the well known NIST Test Suite and Diehard Test set for statistical validation. Output binary streams from the proposed modified generator were examined for randomness using both Test Suites with all tests successfully passed for both experimental chaotic circuit and PSpice simulation model which was used as a yardstick for statistical attributes. The hardware implementation of proposed TRBG has been constructed as a combination of chaotic generator analog circuitry on PCB and PRBSG digital operation leading to binary digit generation in FPGA. This TRSG system could be easily implemented as a complete hardware integrated cryptographic module for usage in mobile communication platform applications.

Both instruction sets are found in ARMv7-A ISA compatible processors, such as the ARM Cortex-A8 and Cortex-A9. The code size reduction when using a variable length instruction set is well understood and can be significant. The focus of this paper is the performance advantage of increased code density.

Comparative reliability analysis between AMBA and network-on-chip: An MPEG-2 case study###We present comparative reliability analysis between shared-bus AMBA and network-on-chip (NoC) in the presence of single-event upsets (SEUs) using MPEG-2 video decoder as a case study. Employing SystemC-based cycle-accurate fault simulations, we investigate how the decoder reliability is affected when SEUs are injected into the computation cores and communication interconnects of the decoder. We show that for a given soft error rate, AMBA-based decoder experiences higher SEUs during computation due to higher execution time. On the other hand, NoC-based decoder experiences higher SEUs during inter-core communication due to higher channel latency and resource usage in the interconnects. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of total SEUs at application-level for NoC- and AMBA-based decoders.

Clear benefits in implementation area and accuracy can be reached when using mismatch calibration based on combination selection of fine-tuning transistors. However, with the high accuracy requirements, the effects of temperature must be taken into the account. Temperature compensation circuitry for combination selection based mismatch calibration is developed, designed and simulated in digital 65 nm CMOS technology. The new temperature compensated and mismatch calibrated current source achieves 99% accuracy in 4Â¿ confidence over the temperature range of 40 degrees in centigrade. This range can still be extended by recalibrating the current source in intervals of 20 degrees in centigrade.

Generic integer linear programming formulation for 3D IC partitioning###The success of 3D ICs requires novel EDA techniques. Among them, this paper focuses on 3D IC partitioning, especially at the architectural level to maximize its benefits. We first derive logical formulations for 3D IC partitioning problems and then transform the formulations into integer linear programs (ILPs). The ILPs can minimize the footprint and the usage of vertical interconnects simultaneously. Our results conducted on the GSRC benchmark show that our approach outperforms the extended multi-way partitioning method in the usage of vertical interconnects under the same footprint settings. More importantly, our approach is very flexible and can readily extend to the partitioning problems with variant objectives and constraints, and with different abstract levels, e.g., from the architectural level down to the physical level. This flexibility makes the ILP formulations superior alternatives to the 3D IC partitioning problems.

OAL: An obstacle-aware legalization in standard cell placement with displacement minimization###Legalization is one of the most critical steps in modern placement tool designs. Since several objectives like wirelength, routability, or temperature are already optimized in global placement stage. The objective of legalization is not only to align the cells overlap-free to the rows, but also to preserve the solution of global placement, i.e., the displacement of cells needs to be minimized. Furthermore, modern chip designs often consist of many preplaced blocks, such as analog blocks, memory blocks, and/or I/O buffers, which are fi ed in the chip and cannot overlap with other blocks. These preplaced blocks, i.e., obstacles, impose more constraints on the legalization problem. A legalization algorithm without considering obstacles may significant induce increasing cell displacement or inferior solutions. In this paper, we present OAL, an obstacle-aware legalization with displacement minimization. The main contributions of our work are: (1) an exact linear wirelength model to minimize total displacement precisely; (2) an obstacle-aware cell insertion technique to handle the relative order problem for advanced displacement minimization. Compared with the state-of-a-art Tetris and Abacus algorithms, experimental results show that our legalizer obtains very high-quality results on legalized NTUplace3 global placements on ISPD 2005 and 2006 placement contest benchmarks and 5 industrial benchmarks.

Enhancement of grid-based spatially-correlated variability modeling for improving SSTA accuracy###Statistical timing analysis for manufacturing variability requires modeling of spatially-correlated variation. Common grid-based modeling for spatially-correlated variability involves a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, especially for PCA (principal component analysis).

Experimental results show that the spatial interpolation realizes a continuous expression of spatial correlation, and reduces the maximum error of timing estimates that originates from sparse spatial grids For attaining the same accuracy, the proposed interpolation reduced CPU time for PCA by 97.7% in a test case.

An adaptive congestion-aware routing algorithm for mesh network-on-chip platform###In this paper, an adaptive congestion-aware routing algorithm is proposed for mesh network-on-chip (NoC) platforms. Depending on the traffic around the routed node, the proposed routing algorithm provides not only minimum paths but also non-minimum paths for routing packets. Both minimum and non-minimum paths are based on the odd-even turn model to avoid deadlock and livelock problems. The decision of the minimum paths or non-minimum paths depends on the utilities of buffers in neighbor nodes and the specific switching value. In this adaptive algorithm, the congestion conditions and distributed hotspots will be avoided. It has the advantages of getting higher performance and also reducing the latency. From the simulation results, it shows that the adaptive congestion-aware routing algorithm is superior to other algorithms for the mesh NoC platforms.

Accurate power estimation of hardware co-processors using system level simulation###Managing power consumption in a System-On-Chip (SoC) design is becoming increasingly important. SoCs generally consist of various co-processors. Accurate power estimation of these co-processors at the highest possible abstraction level helps in performing early power-aware design tradeoffs. This paper presents a methodology to create abstract statistical power models for hardware co-processors and its utilization at system-level for power estimation. In our system-level design environment co-processors are realized as Finite State Machine with Datapath (FSMD) and co-simulated with simulation model of ARM processor. Our power modeling methodology comprises of a learning and utilization phase. In the learning phase, we obtain state specific combinational signal toggling statistics from the FSMD simulation and derive a regression based power model. Consequently, we utilize this power model of FSMD in the full-chip simulation for faster computation of power estimates based on the activities of the FSMD model. Through a number of experimental designs, we show that with a relatively short learning phase no more than 6% worst-case and 4% rms error is observed with respect to the RTL power estimation techniques.

Energy minimization using a greedy randomized heuristic for the voltage assignment problem in NoC###Scaling down the voltage levels of the processing elements (PEs) in a Network-on-Chip (NoC) can significantly reduce the computation energy consumption with an overhead of the level shifters between two adjacent PEs operating at two different voltage levels. The objective of the voltage assignment problem in the NoC domain is to assign a voltage level to each PE within its allowable voltage range such that the overall energy consumption, due to the processing of the PEs and the level shifters, is minimized subject to the task deadline constraints. In this paper, we formulate the voltage assignment problem as a Quadratic Programming (QP) and reduce it to an Integer Linear Program (ILP). A greedy randomized heuristic is then proposed for solving the voltage assignment problem. Experimental results based on the E3S benchmark suite show the quality of our proposed heuristic as for all the benchmark applications it finds solutions close to the optimal ones in negligible amount of time. The effectiveness of the approach of using multiple voltage levels for the PEs in energy minimization is also reflected from the experimental results.

A new generation of C-base synthesis tool and domain-specific computing###The first part of the tutorial presents a platform-based compilation and synthesis system, named xPilot, developed at UCLA. The xPilot provides advanced behavioral synthesis capability for compiling C, C++, or SystemC applications to high quality RTL code optimized for a given FPGA or ASIC platforms for logic, interconnects, and memory optimization with flexible performance and area trade-off. It includes a number of algorithmic innovations, such as scheduling based on the system of difference constraints, resource binding for distributed memory architectures, simultaneous register and functional unit binding, etc. The xPilot system has been licensed by AutoESL Design Technologies, Inc. for commercialization. The AutoPilot tool from AutoESL, derived from xPilot, has been successfully used for a number of FPGA designs. One application of using such C-to-FGPA compilation systems as xPilot or AutoPilot is to enable domain-specific computing using FPGAs as customized computing engines for accelerating a wide range of applications. The recent developments by AMD to open up its HyperTransport bus and Intel to open up its Front-side Bus lead to new high-performance computing platforms with high-bandwidth communication between CPUs and FPGAs, which make it possible to develop high-performance, power-efficient domain-specific computing platforms.

ILP-based scheme for timing variation-aware scheduling and resource binding###The impact of process variations on circuit timing increases rapidly as technology scales. Consequently, it is important to consider timing variations at the early stages of circuit designs. Conventional high level synthesis relies on the worst-case delay analysis to guide the design space exploration, however, such worst-case timing analysis can results in overly conservative designs with pessimistic performance estimation. This paper presents a 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP) formulation that aims at reducing the impact of timing variations in high-level synthesis, by integrating overall timing yield constraints into scheduling and resource binding. The proposed approach focuses on how to achieve the maximum performance (minimum latency) under given timing yield constraints with affordable computation time. Experiment results show that significant latency reduction is achieved under different timing yield constraints, compared to traditional worst-case based approach.

The role of interconnects in the performance scalability of multicore architectures###In this paper, we investigate how the interconnects used for instruction and data communication between the cores and the memory system limit multi-core chip performance scalability. We show the extent to which this limitation can be alleviated by: (1) using a simple thread scheduling approach that balances memory access demands across cores, (2) using techniques (such as compression) that improve effective interconnect bandwidth, and (3) a combination of the two. We find that, across a range of SPEC CINT2000 programs, the first approach improves multi-core chip performance by 14.99%-33.31%, the second approach by 22.28%-64.43%, and the third by 33.97%-87.92%.

Partitioned reuse cache for energy-efficient soft-error protection of functional units###With aggressive technology scaling, soft errors (changes in logic state arising from single-event transients due to radiation or electrical noise) are becoming a serious concern in logic circuits. Existing soft-error rate (SER) reduction schemes, which use explicit hardware and/or temporal redundancy, have significant power overheads and are impractical in systems where power is a key design metric. Our technique exploits the inherent redundancy of operand values across instructions by storing and reusing previously-computed results. Functional units are partitioned so that subunits operate on input subwords to generate output subwords that are combined to form the complete output word. We use a partitioned reuse cache which stores previously computed results for each functional subunit. The stored entries in the cache are compared against computed results of functional subunits to detect soft errors. We show that a partitioned reuse cache has a much better hit rate compared to a non-partitioned cache and it is possible to achieve SER reduction up to 51.87% in functional units with a power overhead of only 7.5%.

Extensible software emulator for reconfigurable instruction cell based processors###This paper presents a novel high-speed behavioural simulator (software-based emulator) for reconfigurable instruction cell based processors. These architectures are particularly suited to providing low-power, low-cost implementations of applications in a streaming environment, such as image signal processing, video playback, or base-band signal processing. As a result, many realistic applications operate on very large data sets, so simulation time plays a key role in the time to market. The key aspect of this work is an efficient serialisation algorithm (based on topological sort), able to capture the intricacies of reconfigurable processors that can be reconfigured very rapidly (ns). This allows for a new generation of high-speed emulation models to be constructed. The performance of this algorithm deployed in an interpreter-based model is compared to other simulation techniques. The emulator can achieve performance around two orders of magnitude higher than current event-driven software models, and similar to that of an FPGA-based model. This brings the simulation times low enough to be able to use this technology as the basis for feedback-directed optimisation, which can significantly improve the performance of application code.

Nanoscale on-chip decoupling capacitors###A distributed on-chip decoupling capacitor network is proposed in this paper to replace one large capacitor. A system of distributed on-chip decoupling capacitors is shown to provide an efficient solution for providing the required on-chip decoupling capacitance under existing technology constraints. In a system of distributed on-chip decoupling capacitors, each capacitor is sized based on the parasitic impedance of the power distribution grid. To be effective, on-chip decoupling capacitors should be charged before the next switching cycle. A design space for estimating the maximum parasitic resistance of the power distribution grid during discharge and the charging phase has been determined. Related simulation results for typical values of the on-chip parasitic resistance are also presented. An analytic solution is shown to provide accurate parameters of the distributed system. The worst case error is 0.002% during discharge and 0.08% during the charging phase as compared to SPICE.

A low power and low area active clock deskewing technique for sub-90nm technologies###Unintentional clock skew caused by variability can result in degraded and unreliable system performance. In this paper, we present a deskewing technique that continuously senses and compensates for unintentional clock skew. It uses an enhanced skew detector block that detects the skew magnitude in addition to the phase. This helps eliminate the need for complex feedback control, thus reducing the power consumption and the area overhead. Simulation results on a benchmark circuit in 65 nm technology show that the deskewed clock has less than 1 ps skew at clock frequencies of upto 2.5 GHz and 55 ps of input skew. Power consumed and area overhead in the deskew circuit is reduced by greater than 50% and 40% respectively, compared to other techniques. Montecarlo simulation of process variations shows maximum output skew of less than 18 ps, and a standard deviation of 1 mW in power consumed in the deskewing circuit.

A coarse-grained Dynamically Reconfigurable MAC Processor for power-sensitive multi-standard devices###We have designed a coarse-grained, dynamically reconfigurable architecture, specifically for implementing the wireless MAC layer in consumer hand-held devices. The dynamically reconfigurable MAC Processor is a SoC architecture that uses a reconfigurable hardware co-processor to delegate critical tasks. The co-processor can reconfigure packet-by-packet, handling upto 3 data streams of different protocols concurrently. We present results of simulations involving transmission and reception of packets, showing that the platform concurrently handles three protocol streams, reconfigures dynamically, yet meets and exceeds the protocol timing constraints, all at a moderate frequency. Thus we show that this architecture is capable of replacing up to three MAC processors in a wireless device. Its heterogeneous and coarse-grained functional units, requirements of limited connectivity between these units, and the idle time of hardware resources promise a very modest power-consumption, suitable for mobile devices.

Power optimization for FinFET-based circuits using genetic algorithms###Reducing power consumption is one of the important design goals for circuit designers. Power optimization techniques for bulk CMOS-based circuit designs have been extensively studied. As technology scales, FinFET has been proposed as an alternative for bulk CMOS when technology scales beyond 32 nm technology (E.J. Nowak et al., 2004). In this paper, we propose a power optimization framework for FinFET based circuit design, based on genetic algorithms. We exploit the unique feature of independent gate (IG) controls for FinFET devices to reduce the power consumption, and combine with other low power techniques such as multi-V<sub>dd</sub> and gate sizing to achieve power optimization for FinFET-based circuits. We use 32 nm PTM FinFET device model (W. Zhao and Y. Cao, 2006) and conduct experiments on ISCAS benchmarks. The experimental results show that our methodology can achieve over 80% power reduction while satisfying the same performance constraints, comparing to the case that all the FinFET transistors are tuned to be the fastest ones.

A framework of architectural synthesis for dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs###Reconfiguration latency is an important factor which impacts the system performance in the reconfigurable computing design. In this paper, a framework is proposed that presents a novel approach for an optimal implementation of algorithms on FPGA based reconfigurable system. The method optimizes the temporal partitioning by performing a similar-rate-computing-based architectural synthesis. It gives the possibility to merge the related partitions during the implementation of a target architecture by the architectural synthesis based on reusing of the common task. Our approach proposes a final solution based on the computation of the mutual similar rate (M.S.R.) for a RTR implementation with a synthesis option. The proposed approach attempts to reduce the number of the temporal partitions for minimizing the overall execution time. An example is presented to illustrate this novel approach. With the architectural synthesis, the number of partition was decreased. The results demonstrate that are capable and efficient for an optimized implementation in the reconfigurable design.

Low power 8T SRAM using 32nm independent gate FinFET technology###In this paper, new SRAM cell design methods for FinFET technology are proposed. One of the most important features of FinFET is that the independent front and back gate can be biased differently to control the current and the device threshold voltage. By controlling the back gate of FinFET, SRAM cell can be designed for minimum power consumption. This paper proposes a new 8T (8 transistors) SRAM structure that reduces dynamic power in writing operation and provides wider SNM (static noise margin). Using the new FinFET based 8T SRAM cell, dynamic power consumption is reduced about 48% and the SNM is widened up to 56% compared to the conventional 6T SRAM at the expense of 2% leakage power and 3% write delay increase.

A subthreshold single ended I/O SRAM cell design for nanometer CMOS technologies###Lowering supply voltage is an effective technique for power reduction in memory design, however traditional memory cell design fails to operate, as shown in [3], [10], at ultra-low voltages. Therefore, to operate cells in the subthreshold regime, new cell structures needs to be explored. Towards this, we present a single-ended I/O (SEIO) bit-line latch style 7-transistor static random access memory (SRAM) cell (7T-LSRAM) as an alternative for nanometer CMOS technology which can function in ultra-low voltage regime. Compared to existing 6-transistor (6T) cell or 10-transistor cell design, the proposed cell has 2X improved read stability and 36% better write-ability at lower supply voltage. Furthermore, the 7T-LSRAM has improved process variation tolerance. The area analysis shows that there is 18% increase in area penalty compared to the standard 6T cell, however the improved performance and process variation tolerance could justify the overhead.

Failure analysis for ultra low power nano-CMOS SRAM under process variations###Several design metrics have been used in the past to evaluate the SRAM cell stability. However, most of them fail to provide the exact stability figures as shown in this paper. Therefore, we investigate new stability metrics and report the stability analysis for typical a SRAM cell. In particular, a concept called power metric is introduced. From this metric we derive two new stability figures; static power noise margin (SPNM) and write trip power (WTP). It is shown that these new figures provide better cell stability analysis. Furthermore, we have exhaustively analyzed the impact of different parameters variations such as cell ratio, supply voltage V<sub>dd</sub> and threshold voltage V<sub>th</sub> on SPNM and WTP. Statistical models for estimating SPNM and WTP from intra-die V<sub>th</sub> variations are presented. The estimated results match well with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

However, these benefits come at the expense of significant area, performance, and power consumption overheads compared to ASIC or full-custom circuits. As a typical SOC design will require fabrication of the final integrated circuit, rather than rely on a generic FPGA architecture, an FPGA integrated within an SOC design can be optimized for the specific intended application. In this paper, we present an initial design space exploration framework for generating an application specific FPGA (ASFPGA) by tailoring several FPGA architectural features for a specific hardware circuit to improve the area, delay, or energy consumption compared to traditional FPGA designs and reduce the overheads of utilizing an FPGA compared to ASIC and full custom implementations.

3-D Heterogeneous SoC for detecting and filtering infected biological cells###This paper discusses a 3-D heterogeneous system on a chip (3-D HSoC) for an important biomedical application. Specifically, it discusses the application for detecting and filtering infected cells in blood. For example, leukemia and HIV produce diseased cells that circulate in the blood stream and are characterized by certain surface proteins.

The analog and digital planes of the HSoC can enable this identification capability as discussed in the paper. Simulations show that the attached diseased cells can be correctly detected with a probability ranging from 0.98 to 0.996. We present the architecture and methodology for the detection of diseased cells using an scFv array on the sensor plane, efficient circuits on the analog plane, and the J-platform on the digital plane.

Design of low flicker noise active CMOS mixer###With the development toward an integrated single-chip multi-standard radio receiver, a DCR (direct conversion receiver) is usually preferable due to its low power consumption and low manufactory cost. Backward compatibility to narrow band standards such as GSM/EDGE is also important to avoid possible service interruption. However, the excess flicker noise in modern CMOS technology degrades the DCR sensitivity in narrow band radios. Flicker noise which has most of its power centered in the low frequency band is first introduced to the receiver by the mixer and the degraded noise figure can not be restored by any subsequent amplification or processing. Thus, it is critical to reduce the mixer flicker noise for narrow band applications. In this paper, the flicker noise coupling mechanism in an active CMOS mixer is analyzed and circuit techniques are proposed to significantly lower the mixerpsilas flicker noise.

Analysis of retention time under multi-configuration on a DORGA###Optically reconfigurable gate arrays (ORGAs) have been developed to realize a large virtual gate count by adding a holographic memory onto a programmable gate array VLSI. Up to now, dynamic optically reconfigurable architecture has been proposed to increase the gate count of the ORGA-VLSI part, which uses photodiodes as dynamic memory to store a configuration context and perfectly removes static configuration memories. Consequently, extremely high gate count ORGAs have been realized. However, in this architecture, since background diffraction light of configuration contexts reduces the retention time of circuit information stored in junction capacitances of photodiodes, it has remained a concern that under multi-configuration, an optical configuration can reduce the retention time of other circuits that have already been programmed before the configuration and are functioning on a gate array. This paper clarifies that the dynamic optically reconfigurable architecture is effective even under multi-configuration.

Temperature measurement in Content Addressable Memory cells using bias-controlled VCO###With increasing speed and power density, high performance memories have now begun to require dynamic thermal management (DTM) as processors and hard-drives did. Memory thermal limits (threshold values for throttling) are set-based on worst-case power data which leads to over-guard-banding and performance degradation. To ensure an accurate and closed-loop throttling mechanism we need physical thermal sensors in the memory module.

A timing methodology considering within-die clock skew variations###Timing margining is a key component of timing sign-off. Insufficient margin can lead to silicon failure and excessive pessimistic margin will entail unnecessary design optimization effort. Timing margin is intended to cover the uncertainty in clock arrival times and clock skews arising from within-die process variations. In highly scaled technologies, the increased process variations tend to enforce an overestimation of timing margins making it difficult for the designs to achieve the target performance. In this paper, we present a more efficient margining methodology to account for clock-skew variations arising due to within-die variations. The proposed methodology fits well within current corner based timing sign-off framework and allows for significant reduction in margin pessimism. We present the results and observations on a low power processor for hold-time margin correction. Evaluation of the proposed methodology for hold analysis on a low power processor shows, on average, ~67% reduction in the original margin. Further the margin correction decreases the number of hold-time violations significantly and effectively achieves 10times reduction in hold-violation fixing effort.

An independent-gate FinFET SRAM cell for high data stability and enhanced integration density###Data stability of SRAM cells has become an important issue with the scaling of CMOS technology. SRAM arrays are also an important source of leakage in today&#x2019;s high performance microprocessors. A new six transistor (6T) SRAM cell based on independent-gate (IG) FinFET technology is presented in this paper for simultaneously reducing the active and standby mode power consumption while enhancing the data stability and the integration density. The new IG-FinFET SRAM cell activates only one gate of the data access transistors during a read operation. The disturbance caused by the direct data access mechanism of the standard 6T SRAM cell topology is significantly reduced by dynamically increasing the threshold voltage of the access transistors. All the transistors in the IG-FinFET SRAM cell are sized minimum without producing any data stability concerns. The read static-noise-margin (SNM) of the new circuit is enhanced by up to 2&#x00D7; as compared to the standard tied-gate FinFET SRAM cells. Alternatively, the IG-FinFET SRAM circuit reduces the leakage power and area by up to 51.7% and 10%, respectively, as compared to the standard tied-gate FinFET SRAM circuits sized for comparable data stability in a 32nm FinFET technology.

X-Route: An X-architecture full-chip multilevel router###In this paper, we present an X-architecture multilevel full-chip router, called X-Route. Unlike the traditional &#x039B;-shaped multilevel framework that adopts bottom-up coarsening followed by top-down uncoarsening, our multilevel framework runs in the Vshaped manner: top-down uncoarsening followed by bottom-up coarsening. The top-down uncoarsening stage performs octagonal global routing and X-detailed routing for local nets at each level and then refines the solution for the next level. Then, the bottom-up coarsening stage performs the X-detailed routing to reroute failed nets and refines the solution level by level. Since we perform top-down routing first, global long nets are routed earlier. To prevent a wrong decision from blocking the later nets, we keep a dynamic congestion map that records the updated routing congestion information based on the routed nets and the global-path prediction of the unrouted nets. To take full advantage of the X-architecture, we also develop a progressive X-Steiner tree algorithm based on the delaunay triangulation approach for the X-architecture. Compared with the state-of-the-art &#x039B;-shaped multilevel routing for the X-architecture, experimental results show that our X-Route reduces the respective wirelength and average delay by about 14.05% and 30.62%, with better routing completion.

Several modeling techniques are introduced to facilitate the task. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can very precisely locate the faulty scan cell for almost all benchmark circuits with which we have experimented. In comparison with the existing approaches, the proposed method achieves better diagnosis resolution.

An incremental floorplanning algorithm for temperature reduction###Integrating a large number of transistors in a limited silicon area causes chip temperature to increase rapidly. High temperature incurs a number of design problems such as high leakage power consumption and unreliable operations. It is worthwhile to note that the peak temperature of a chip may go down by finding an optimal floorplanning. Especially, it is very important to consider temporal correlation of temperature states because the temperature of a block may go up or down depending on the temperatures of the surrounding blocks. In this paper, we propose a set of floorplanning techniques to reduce the peak temperature.

H.264/AVC decoder SoC towards the low cost mobile video player###We propose a low cost and stand-alone platform-based SoC for H.264/AVC decoder, whose target is practical mobile applications. The SoC, consisting of RISC core and decoder core, has advantages on flexibility, testability and various I/O interfaces. For decoder core design, the proposed H.264/AVC coprocessor in the SoC employs a new block pipelining scheme instead of conventional macroblock or hybrid one, which greatly contribute to reducing drastically the size of the core and its internal memory. The core size is reduced to 138KGate or 36% less and the memory size is reduced to 3.5KB or 65% less than the conventional hybrid pipelining structure. In our practical development, a single external SDRAM is sufficient for both reference frame buffer and display buffer. Various peripheral interfaces are also provided in a chip.

Low-power high-performance FinFET sequential circuits###Scaling of single-gate bulk MOSFET faces great challenges in the nanometer regime due to the severe short-channel effects that cause an exponential increase in the leakage power. Double-gate MOSFET technologies mitigate this limitation by providing an excellent control over a thin silicon body with two electrically coupled gates. FinFET is the most attractive choice among the double-gate transistor architectures because of the self alignment of the two gates and the similarity of the fabrication steps to the existing standard CMOS technology. In this paper, new sequential circuits based on independent-gate FinFETs are proposed to simultaneously reduce the power consumption and the circuit area. With the proposed independently biased double-gate FinFET sequential circuits, the active power consumption, the leakage power, the clock power, and the circuit area are reduced by up to 46%, 42%, 26%, and 20%, respectively, as compared to the standard sequential circuits with tied-gate FinFETs.

Using power gating techniques in area-array SoC floorplan design###Low power demand drives the development of lower power design architectures, among which power gating is one of the state-of-the-art techniques to achieve low power. MTCMOS (or sleep transistor) is applied when some of the blocks can be switched off without leakage power dissipation. This technique is widely used in circuit level design, but hardly used in higher level design stage. Due to early planning in power delivery for area-array design style, it is necessary to consider the power gating techniques in early SoC physical design stage. This paper presents a framework to insert coarse grain MTCMOS in SoC floorplanning stage, saving mainly leakage power. This work decides which modules have chance to save power by sleep transistors insertion, and reserves enough area for them during floorplanning. The results show that our approach works well and can obtain lower power floorplans with supply noise aware sleep transistor insertion in area-array architecture.

Context-specific leakage and delay analysis of a 65nm standard cell library for lithography-induced variability###A methodology to predict the impact of systematic manufacturing variations on the parametric behavior of standard cells in an integrated circuit is described. Such a methodology can be applied to the analysis of a full chip composed of standard cell components, and reports layout context-dependent changes in chip timing and power. For lithography and etch-induced variability, a study of a 65nm standard cell library has been done to examine the influence of cell context when looking at cell delay and leakage at different focus and exposure conditions. Cell context, or proximity effects from neighboring cells, can have a significant impact on cell performance across a process window, especially through focus, which needs to be considered for silicon-aware circuit analysis. The traditional lookup table approach used in static timing analysis or leakage power analysis needs to be augmented with an instance-specific offset for each cell in a design. Contours need to be generated for each transistor in each cell at different process points and the corresponding delay and leakage offsets should be calculated based on these contours. Electrical characterization also enables the use of other context-specific process models, such as strain and dopant fluctuations, without altering the final output. This allows subsequent tools to use the information for circuit analysis. Such a methodology is thereby useful for process-aware static timing and power analysis.

Intra-die process parameter variation and leakage analysis of cache at the microarchitectural level###As technology scales down to the nanometer domain, leakage currents begin to contribute significantly to the total power consumption of the chip. In addition, it becomes increasingly difficuilt to control the transistor device parameters. This causes increased heat dissipation in the chip and the degradation in the frequency of operation, thus compromising the reliability of the chip. Hence, it becomes necessary to model the leakage currents and variabilities observed in minimum geometry transistors early in the design flow, to be able to design a low-power, dense and robust cache architecture. In this paper, we present CacheSim, a cache memory simulator that includes compact models for both intra-die process parameter variations and leakage currents in the conventional cache architecture, to give an accurate estimate of memory power at the system level, and the cache access time.

The application of the proposed approach based on early wire characterization to the global interconnects of a Network-on-Chip (NoC), clearly shows that the novel method can converge the design to close-to-target solution in very few steps, if not meet the target directly. Furthermore, the irregular solution provided by the traditional flow causes the self and coupling capacitances and therefore the total capacitance vary in a wide spectrum, whereas, the regular structures dictated by the proposed approach result in a uniform distribution of the capacitances.

3-D Topologies for Networks-on-Chip###Several interesting topologies emerge by incorporating the third dimension in the design of networks-on-chip (NoC). An analytic model for the zero-load latency of each network that considers the effect of the topology on the performance of a 3-D NoC is developed. A tradeoff between the number of nodes utilized in the third dimension of the network, which reduces the average number of hops traversed by a packet, and the number of physical planes used to integrate the processing elements (PE) of the network, which decreases the wire delay of the communication channel, is evaluated. A performance improvement of up to 33% is demonstrated for 3-D NoC as compared to a traditional 2-D NoC topology for a network size of N= 128 nodes.

Platform-Based Behavior-Level and System-Level Synthesis###With the rapid increase of complexity in system-on-a-chip (SoC) design, the electronic design automation (EDA) community is moving from RTL (Register Transfer Level) synthesis to behavioral-level and system-level synthesis. The needs of system-level verification and software/hardware co-design also prefer behavior-level executable specifications, such as C or SystemC. In this paper we present the platform-based synthesis system, named xPilot, being developed at UCLA. The first objective of xPilot is to provide novel behavioral synthesis capability for automatically generating efficient RTL code from a C or SystemC description for a given system platform and optimizing the logic, interconnects, performance, and power simultaneously. The second objective of xPilot is to provide a platform-based system-level synthesis capability, including both synthesis for application-specific configurable processors and heterogeneous multi-core systems. Preliminary experiments on FPGAs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a wide range of applications and its value in exploring various design tradeoffs.

The resulting annotated graph enables datapaph structure optimizations for high-level synthesis without increasing dramatically its processing time (complexity: O(n)). The methodology results in an area reduction from 17% to 43% for on a Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) computation used in block matching algorithms. The proposed approach can also be applied in a more general design context for sizing the data of an application knowing the input data formats.

Process Variation Aware Parallelization Strategies for MPSoCs###Scaling of microprocessors is aggravating the gap between design and manufacturing expectations. Such variations may lead to manufacturing of processors cores with frequencies lower or higher than their expected frequencies. In particular, with the rapid advent of multiprocessor system on chips (MPSoC), such manufacturing uncertainties may lead to significant variations in the operating frequencies of different processor cores on the same chip. In this work, we demonstrate that traditional load balanced parallelization schemes need to be revisited to account for such variations. Specifically, we highlight the need for tuning the degree of parallelization and non-uniform workload generation to achieve lower power consumption in next generation MPSoCs.

As against most of the prior work on voltage islands that mainly focused on the architecture design and IP placement issues, this paper studies the necessary software compiler support for voltage islands. Specifically, we focus on an embedded multiprocessor architecture that supports both voltage islands and control domains within these islands, and determine how an optimizing compiler can automatically map an embedded application onto this architecture. Our experiments with the proposed compiler support show that our approach is very effective in reducing energy consumption.

Substrate and Ground Noise Interactions in Mixed-Signal Circuits###The interaction of the substrate with the inductive on-chip ground distribution network is analyzed in this paper. A transistor level approach is presented to illustrate the effects of the substrate on ground noise. The substrate can have a significant effect on ground noise due to the inductance of the ground lines. For a CMOS inverter, the substrate can reduce negative peak ground noise by 49% during the high-to-low output transition. The substrate, however, increases the positive peak ground noise by 72% during the low-to-high output transition. The effect of the substrate should therefore not be neglected if the inductance of the on-chip ground distribution network is non-negligible. Furthermore, conventional triangle or trapezoid type current demand estimations of the nonlinear circuits are shown to be significantly inaccurate if the ground lines exhibit inductive behavior.

Effects of Interconnect Process Variations on Signal Integrity###With the development of new sub micron very large scale integration (VLSI) technologies the importance of interconnect parasitics on delay and noise has been in an ever increasing trend [1]. Consequently, the variations in interconnect parameters have a larger impact on final timing and functional yield of the product. Therefore, it is necessary to handle process variations as accurately as possible in layout parasitic extraction (LPE), static timing (ST) and signal integrity (SI) in deep sub-micron designs. In this paper we analyze the sources of process variation that induce interconnect parasitic variations. We present the relatively important ones through the usage of a response surface model (RSM). It was found that, in addition to metal thickness and width variation, damaged dielectric regions on the side of the metal lines are important contributions to cross-talk. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for the correlation between parameters for a given interconnect line such as interconnect line resistance and thickness. Finally we present a Monte Carlo (MC) methodology based on the RSM which can significantly reduce separation of corners and lead to tighter product specs and hence smaller die area and lower power.

We propose a Cell Switched NoC (CS-NoC) paradigm that requires less buffer space than wormhole routing. It has been demonstrated that cell switched network has higher throughput, lower latency than wormhole routing, and are less sensitive to bursty traffic. Therefore, CS-NoC is a promising candidate for billion-transistor SoCs.

High Read Stability and Low Leakage SRAM Cell Based on Data/Bitline Decoupling###Data in conventional six transistor (6T) static random access memory (SRAM) cells are vulnerable to noise due to the direct coupling of data storage nodes to the bit lines during a read operation. Lowering of supply and threshold voltages leads to a significant degradation in SRAM cell stability with the scaling of CMOS technology. The SRAM cell stability is further degraded due to the process parameter variations in deeply scaled CMOS technologies. In addition to the data stability issues, the increasing leakage energy consumption of on-chip caches is another growing concern. In this paper, a new nine transistor (9T) SRAM cell with enhanced read stability and reduced leakage power consumption is proposed.

Silicon Debug and DFT for SOC IP###Nanometer circuits and fabrication process both are becoming increasingly complex at the same time. The very nature of silicon defects continue to evolve with these ground shift and are now focused on timing, signal integrity and process variations [1]. It is not enough to simply have full scan ATPG vectors. There will be diagnostics built into the ATPG tools to fall back on when the ATPG tests fail, but these don't help debug timing defects and when the fail test data is compressed [2]. When yields fall and there is a danger to miss the TTM, TTP, TTx windows, the SOC integrator must be ready for quick debug. Silicon Debug has evolved to be a process that requires planning, tools, and engineering resources. The basic DFT principles of controllability and observability need to be extended to isolate a failing IP. Last but not the least, both SOC IP provider and integrator need to support diagnostics or Failure Analysis to zero-in on a defect. Nanometer fails require a paradigm shift, from Design Â¿ for-Test to Design-for-Debug. This tutorial will help the attendees recognize, enjoin and improve the Debug paradigm.

Fuse Area Reduction Based on Quantitative Yield Analysis and Effective Chip Cost###Embedded memory yield dominates manufacturing yield of the chip and yield enhancement techniques for embedded memories are important for entire SoC yield increase. Laser fuses and anti fuses are two commonly used mechanisms for hard repair and they consume a lot of area. Analysis based upon yield prediction methods as well as silicon yield database shows that putting fuse to repair all the memories on the chip is not worth the expense, when only few fuse bits are needed. In this paper, we present the background for fuse reduction (cost analysis) and propose methodology to compress total number of fuses to repair the memories such that cost reduction through hard repair circuitry is maximized. The idea is to take into consideration factors like memory yield, fuse yield and repair logic yield, together with the number of memories on chip, to finally decide the fuse compression ratio.

Crosstalk-aware Energy Reduction in NoC Communication Fabrics###Interconnect fabrics of multi-core systems - on-chip are confronted with increased crosstalk effects and energy dissipation. Crosstalk avoidance coding (CAC) is a promising way to reduce the coupling capacitance of the interconnect wires. We propose a method to address both crosstalk and energy dissipation in networks-on-chip (NoC) by modifying the structure of the data packets and reducing the number of coding-decoding operations. Our results show that by incorporating crosstalk avoidance coding (CAC) schemes in the NoC data stream it is possible to save a significant amount of energy while communicating between multiple IP cores.

Performance Constraints Aware Voltage Islands Generation in SoC Floorplan Design###Using voltage island methodology to reduce power consumption for system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs has become more and more popular recently. Currently this approach has been considered either in system-level architecture or post-placement stage. Since hierarchical design and reusable intellectual property (IP) are widely used, it is necessary to optimize floorplanning/placement methodology considering voltage islands generation to solve power and critical path delay problems. In this paper, we propose a floorplanning methodology considering voltage islands generation and performance constraints. Our method is flexible and can be extended to hierarchical design. The experimental results on some MCNC benchmarks show that our method is effective in meeting performance constraints and simultaneously considers the tradeoff between power routing cost and the assignment of supply voltage in modules.

Consideration of Transition-Time Variability in Statistical Timing Analysis###This paper discusses the treatment of the transition-time variability in statistical static timing analysis (SSTA). In SSTA, the signal arrival time is treated as a statistical variable. In reality, the signal transition time also fluctuates due to process variations, which effect should be taken into account. Also, in a multiple fan-in gate, there exist multiple transition-time variabilities associated with each input. Effective treatment of the multiple possibilities is required. This paper first discusses the effect of transition-time variability on the delay distribution. A method is proposed that derives the variability of transition time from the delay variability and considers the effect of transition-time variability using a linearized model. An experiment shows that the error of the method is less than 0.2% whereas the error grows to 4% if we neglect the effect of transition-time variability. For multiple fan-in gates, we convert multiple transition time variabilities into a single variability by taking a weighted average of the variabilities. The error of the conversion is around 1% in our experiments. The proposed treatments of the transition-time variability improve the accuracy of SSTA without changing the framework of existing SSTA methods.

On Achieving Low-Power SoC Clock Tree Synthesis by Transition Time Planning via Buffer Library Study###Clock power dissipation has become a significant issue since it occupies around half of the total system power. Due to high working frequency in modern system designs, the transition time of the clock signal is extremely short. In order to keep up with this trend and to use less wire area, a large number of buffers have to be inserted in the network. As a consequence, short-circuit power of the clock buffers is no longer negligible. In this paper, we introduce a methodology which can be applied in global clock tree synthesis to achieve low short-circuit power. It is based on the analysis of any given buffer library in manipulating buffer transition time and hierarchical clustering of loads during buffer insertion. The experimental results are encouraging. Since there are very few works on gate/buffer sizing or buffer library analysis to overcome clocking power problem, we compare our approach with a greedy buffer sizing approach and obtain 13.7% clock power saving for a 10,000 flip-flop design under user-specified clock skew constraints.

Compared to bulk CMOS technology, FinFET circuits have lower functional power supply and lower optimal energy consumption in subthreshold region. In addition, FinFET has better soft error immunity in sub-threshold region.

Embedded Controllers for Solving Complex Industry Applications###Complex industry automation as well as complex compute nodes like high-end servers require an infrastructure for maintenance and control. An off-the-shelf embedded controller is usually the first choice for such purposes. This approach is challenged for complex applications by the fact that a large amount of distributed industry standard interfaces has to be controlled and realtime responses have to be provided. In our paper we show a concept solving the above challenges. Our solution is based on an embedded PowerPC 440* controller that allows for flexible attachment and control of hundreds of industry standard interfaces like digital I/O, I<sup>2</sup>C, JTAG, RS232/422 etc. The solution further allows a redundant implementation of controllers for fail save applications. This approach was implemented first in a set of IBM servers and can be generalized to other application areas like compute clusters or industry automation. We describe the challenges in complex applications for system control, show our solutions on a system level and finally describe how a concrete SoC chip is realized in PowerPC* CoreConnect* technology.

Tutorial: RAM-based Circuits and Architectures for Multimedia and Signal Processing SOCs###In recent years, a growing class of SOCs has emerged for mobile applications, such as portable desktops, digital pens, audio- and video-based multimedia products, wireless communications and imaging systems, personal digital assistants, personal communicators and smart cards. These SOCs demand high-speed, high-throughput computations, complex functionalities and often real-time processing capabilities. The performance of these SOCs is mostly limited by lifetime of batteries. Thus, new design approaches and methodologies that produce more power-efficient and higher throughput designs are greatly desired. In recent years, the use of SIMD (single instruction multiple data) or MIMD (multiple instruction multiple data) architectures is spreading into the general DSP domain due to recent innovations that boost performance and flexibility of the architectures by several orders of magnitude. The Processor-in-Memory (PIM) environment provides a unique prospective because the impact of low-power techniques on performance is more sensitive in PIM than in standard RAM. The performance balancing in PIM architectures plays a critical role. Even though PIM concept is not new, recent breakthroughs pushed the application domain from traditional multimedia use to general signal processing use. This tutorial provides a unique overview and prospective of these recent developments to a much broader audience.

Cache Organization for Embeded Processors: CAM-vs-SRAM###Caches are becoming an increasingly important part of embedded processor design because of the impact they have on performance as well as implementation, specifically, area, power and timing. Different cache organizations make tradeoffs between these metrics. One of the main architectural choices is whether to use standard SRAM-based tag design or to go with a CAM- based organization. This choice has far reaching consequences on all other aspects of the cache design. We will compare these two cache styles using results from a recently completed DSP core design. Our conclusion is that, contrary to popular belief, an SRAM-tag based design provided a more optimal overall design point and is superior in energy respect. Some of driving factors such as the increasing dominance of wire and leakage power will be extrapolated forward to next generation processes.

Method for Managing Electromigration in SOC'S When Designing for Both Reliability and Manufacturing###Like design for manufacturing (DFM), design for reliability (DFR) of a chip identifies design features that are potentially vulnerable to various physical effects that can degrade circuit performance. The difference is that DFR attempts to model long-term effects, such as electromigration. Tools extract design information (resistances and current densities) and apply the data to simulation tools to estimate the degree of reliability. The weakness in this methodology is that these extraction technologies assume that the "as drawn" feature is a good representation of the "as manufactured" chip. DFM has shown that individual features on the "as manufactured" chip can vary dramatically from the intended layout in both critical dimension and thickness. The technologies developed to identify and characterize these DFM variations need to be incorporated into the DFR tools to accurately predict the long-term life of SoC nanometer designs.

Automatic Synthesis of Interface Circuits from Simplified IP Interface Protocols and Matching Information###Automatic interface synthesis generates product FSM from interface FSMs of IP. But complicated interface FSM may lead to a very large product FSM which results in large interface circuits. So we propose a simplified interface FSM description scheme where transactions are represented based on transfers and several parameters. In addition, the interface circuit is generated by considering only those transactions which are involved in matching information. By virtue of matching information we could generate the interface circuits which may not be easy to generate with previous methods due to inability to consider the differences in characteristics of interface protocols of IP. Through experiments we observed that our description scheme helps reduce the size of interface circuits and our synthesis method correctly generates the interface circuits between IPs with different characteristics.

3.48mW 2.4GHz range Frequency Synthesizer Architecture with Two-Point Channel Control for Fast Settling Performance###A new frequency synthesizer architecture with low-power and very short settling time is introduced for 2.4GHz ZigBee applications. It uses two-point channel control with divider control and direct VCO control. A DAC with tunable gain is used along with a linearized varactor for the direct VCO control path. Despite the use of an integer-N architecture with 50kHz loop bandwidth, we have achieved a frequency settling time of less than 10musec for 80MHz frequency jumping from 2400MHz. The proposed modified-TSPC circuit topology with 2-transistor stacks operational with lower supply voltage is used for the high frequency divider circuits. With a lowered supply voltage of 1.0V, the power consumption is significantly reduced and so is the switching noise induced by TSPC and digital circuits. With the -112 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1MHz offset from 2.44GHz, total power consumption using 0.18mum CMOS technology is only 3.48mW

An IR drop-driven placer for standard cells in a SOC design###A partition-based IR drop-driven algorithm is proposed for standard cell placement. Different cost functions for reducing IR drop are used in the horizontal cut and vertical cut partitioning processes. In addition to minimizing the total wire length, we balance the power consumption of the two partitions during the horizontal cut partitioning process. During the vertical cut partitioning process, we move the cells with higher power consumption closer to the power sources to reduce the maximum IR drop of the row. After placement is finished, we apply a greedy placement refinement process to further reduce the value of the maximum IR drop. Each standard cell row is modeled with an equivalent conductance model. Then the IR drop of each row is calculated and analyzed. We compare the placement generated by the proposed approach with the wire length-driven placement. On average, the proposed approach improves the value of maximum IR drop by 51%. Therefore, it reduces the need to add power straps on the chip and more routing resources are saved

Mapping of partial reconfigurable data flows to Xilinx FPGAs###Recently, commercially available Xilinx FPGAs have started to support partial run time reconfiguration (RTR) wherein part of the FPGA can be reconfigured while the rest of the FPGA logic is functioning. However, access to the FPGA for RTR is not completely flexible and needs a systematic partitioning of the FPGA fabric into static and reconfigurable partitions within certain pretty tight constraints. Modules mapped to different partitions need to communicate using specialized macros. In this paper, we present a method for mapping a data flow requiring partial RTR to the Xilinx FPGAs. We develop a cost function that guides the mapping of nodes to these partitions by attempting to minimize the communication cost while ensuring that the required RTR is completed within certain time constraints

Integrated assignment of registers and functional units for heterogeneous vliw-architectures###Typically, modern digital signal processors with VLIW-like architectures provide several functional units and register files. To limit the number of interconnects, register files are fully connected only to a subset of the functional units. Transferring data from arbitrary register files to functional units may be subject to bus constraints. Additionally, the set of functional units is often heterogeneous where certain operations like addition may be performed by several units while others like multiplication are limited to a single unit. Register assignment and functional unit assignment are two interdependent code generation phases for these architectures. Although both of them are hard combinatorial optimization problems, we present a combined approach that generates optimum solutions. This is achieved by a pruned search space representation based on interval graphs. Together with an adapted resource model we show the feasibility of optimum solution space exploration for current architectures like TI's C6x family

Our framework can be used with several objective functions such as energy, performance, and fallibility (opposite of reliability). We use dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) for reducing energy consumption while we employ task duplication to minimize fallibility

Synchronous latency-insensitive design for multiple clock domain###Modern system-on-chip designs often require multiple clock frequencies. On the other hand, global interconnects suffer large delays. This paper proposes a method that manages these two problems within the framework of conventional synchronous design flow. The design is partitioned into isochronous blocks already at behavioral level, where each block is synchronous using a local clock. The local clock frequencies are assumed related by rational numbers. Communication between blocks is managed with FIFOs at each receiver, which manage different clock frequencies and hide unknown delays or clock skews. This method guarantees clock true implementation of a clock true behavioral description utilizing a predefined block-to-block latency.

An improved implementation method of AHB BusMatrix###The multi-layer AHB BusMatrix (ML-AHB BusMatrix) proposed by ARM allows parallel access paths between multiple masters and slaves in a system. But, there is one clock cycle delay for each master in the ML-AHB BusMatrix of ADK (AMBA&trade; design kit) whenever the master restarts the transactions or changes the slave layers because of the input stage and arbitration logic implemented with Moore type. In this paper, we present one way to improve the ML-AHB BusMatrix structure of ADK. With the elimination of the input stage and some restrictions on the arbitration scheme, we could not only take away the one clock cycle delay but also reduce the area overhead and power consumption. Experimental results show that the one clock cycle delay is removed. Besides the average dynamic power, static power, total area overhead and clock period of ameliorated ML-AHB BusMatrix are reduced by 42%, 64%, 33% and 33% respectively, compared with the ML-AHB BusMatrix of ADK.

Resistive Loss and Trans-Impedance Characterization of Nonlinear Transmission Lines on CMOS SOI Substrate###We report the characterization of nonlinear transmission lines (NLTL) implemented with the MIT Lincoln Lab 0.18mum FDSOI (fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator) CMOS process up to 35GHz directly from S-parameter measurements. NLTL interconnect can significantly reduce the effective resistance loss while maintaining comparable inductance, capacitance, and conductance to those of normal interconnect lines in a broadband of frequencies. Hence, the signal integrity in high-speed interconnects can be improved. NLTL also provides a convenient way to tune the transmission-line characteristic impedance for impedance matching at microwave frequencies. Excellent properties of return and insertion losses further illustrate the competitive advantage of the NLTL as the interconnect line on CMOS substrates for system-on-a-chip (SoC) applications

Effective IP reuse for high quality SOC design###Intellectual property (IP) reuse is essential for meeting the challenges of system-on-a-chip (SoC) design productivity improvement, design quality and meeting time-to-market goals. However, IP quality issues in terms of inadequate test coverage, low power capability, absence of functional features etc. has led to reduced benefits from reuse. This is because the IP is usually designed for use in one chip and later on (re)used in chips having different requirements. Hence, part of SoC design productivity is spent in enhancing the IP to the desired quality level. In a joint development program with the customer, where it is required to integrate some of their IPs, the usual paradigm followed for reuse has to be enhanced beyond the state-of-the-art to meet the design goals. As updated versions of the IP may be released several times during the SoC design phase, managing the design database poses challenge with respect to the IP enhancements.

System Level Design Methodology for System On Chips using Multi-Threaded Graphs###Multi threaded graph (MTG) models are expressive in explicitly representing the concurrency, event synchronization, data sharing and timing constraint aspects of a system. Because of their rich expressiveness and visual appeal, MTGs are also useful in conceptualizing these aspects of a system on chip (SoC), before designing them. Each intellectual property block of a system can be captured into an MTG and composed together to represent the SoC. To facilitate a design methodology based on MTGs, we have created a flow starting from capturing the control flow and data flow features of an SoC in a visual modeling framework for MTGs and translating to a formal model for verification using the UPPAAL model checker. The visual modeling front-end for MTGs is developed using the generic modeling environment (GME) tool that helps catch modeling errors at early stages of the design due to the syntactic and semantic constraints of the metamodel. The MTG representation is translated into extended timed automata (XTA) format that can be accepted by UPPAAL model checker. By translating the MTG to UPPAAL, important timing constraints, synchronization, deadlock freedom, etc can be formally verified. We have experimented with two non-trivial case studies of an FIR filter model and RISC CPU model

Using system-level simulation, it is shown that the application of WPM routing decreases power by 14% and core area by 28% for a core area-centric design, and for a wire coupling-centric design, power reduces by 6% and wire coupling by 20%

Adaptive MTCMOS for dynamic leakage and frequency control using variable footer strength###Deviations in leakage and delay due to process variation have increased greatly with technology scaling. This paper presents two adaptive MTCMOS schemes to address the growing leakage and delay spreads found in modem high-performance designs. Variable-gate voltage MTCMOS adjusts the applied gate voltage on footer devices while variable-width MTCMOS adaptively turns on or off footers in a circuit block. Both techniques compensate for the spread in leakage and delay. Our results show a 21%-61% decrease in runtime leakage with a worst-case delay penalty of 9%.

Shifted Leakage Power Characteristics of Dynamic Circuits Due to Gate Oxide Tunneling###The subthreshold and gate oxide leakage power characteristics of domino logic circuits are evaluated in this paper. The preferred input vectors and node voltage states are identified to minimize the total leakage power consumption in the sleep mode. New low leakage design guidelines based on the results are presented. Previous studies indicate that a discharged dynamic node voltage state with high inputs is preferable to reduce the subthreshold leakage power consumption in an idle dual threshold voltage domino gate. However, the gate oxide leakage is ignored in the previous studies. The significantly increased gate dielectric tunneling current, as described in this paper, shifts the leakage power characteristics of dynamic circuits in the sub-65nm CMOS technologies. Contrary to the previously published techniques in older technologies, a charged dynamic node voltage state with low inputs is preferred for reducing the total leakage power consumption in the wide fan-in dual threshold voltage domino gates. Similarly, a charged dynamic node voltage state with low inputs is preferred for lowering the leakage power consumption in all types of low threshold voltage domino gates in a 45nm CMOS technology

Workload Clustering for Increasing Energy Savings on Embedded MPSoCs###Voltage/frequency scaling and processor low-power modes (i.e., processor shut-down) are two important mechanisms used for reducing energy consumption in embedded MPSoCs. While a unified scheme that combines these two mechanisms can achieve significant savings in some cases, such an approach is limited by the code parallelization strategy employed. In this paper, we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) based workload clustering strategy across parallel processors, oriented towards maximizing the number of idle processors without impacting original execution times. These idle processors can then be switched to a low power mode to maximize energy savings, whereas the remaining ones can make use of voltage/frequency scaling. In order to check whether this approach brings any energy benefits over the pure voltage scaling based, pure processor shut-down based, or a simple unified scheme, we implemented four different approaches and tested them using a set of eight array/loop-intensive embedded applications. Our simulation-based analysis reveals that the proposed ILP based approach: (1) is very effective in reducing the energy consumptions of the applications tested; and (2) generates much better energy savings than all the alternate schemes tested (including a unified scheme that combines voltage/frequency scaling and processor shutdown)

DG-SRAM: a low leakage memory circuit###The gate oxide thickness in sub-70nm process technologies approaches the limit where direct gate tunneling current starts to play a significant role in both off-state and on-state transistors. This gate leakage current coupled with the subthreshold leakage, results in a dramatic increase in total leakage power. Hence, efficient power reduction strategies that directly address the gate leakage component are necessary. In this paper, we present a diode-gated SRAM (DG-SRAM) that uses two additional NMOS (or PMOS) transistors to decrease the gate leakage in very deep sub-micron (VDSM) cache and embedded memories. Our simulation results on 65nm process (Berkeley Predictive Technology Model) for an oxide thickness of 1.5nm indicate a reduction of about 69% of the gate leakage and 65% of total leakage for NMOS-connected DG-SRAM as compared to the conventional SRAM, with minimal area overhead and no significant loss in performance or stability.

On-Chip Memory Management for Embedded MpSoC Architectures Based on Data Compression###One must be very careful in utilizing the available on-chip memory space in embedded MpSoC architectures, which may be very challenging due to data sharing among processors. This paper proposes and evaluates an on-chip memory space management strategy based on data compression. The proposed strategy first uses a compiler analysis that reveals the order in which different data blocks are required by the application. After that, it builds an integer linear programming based representation of the on-chip memory space management problem, and solves it using a publicly-available integer linear programming tool. The solution gives the optimum order in which data blocks should be compressed and decompressed to minimize execution cycles or energy consumption under an on-chip memory capacity limit

I Models and Tools for the Dynamic Reconfiguration of FPGAs###This tutorial outline summarizes the tools and the methods that are used to bridge the design gap between the specification of a dynamically reconfigurable application and its implementation in a FPGA system. The tools and methods used when designing dynamically reconfigurable systems are influenced by the target application domain. In this tutorial, it is assumed that the application is an embedded processor system implemented in a single platform FPGA. Dynamic reconfiguration will be used to time-multiplex mutually exclusive sub-components in the system architecture that are used periodically. Simulating dynamically reconfigurable systems in RTL simulators has been investigated but RTL simulators normally do not allow the topology of the system architecture to change during simulation. 'Virtual multiplexors', placed at subcomponent I/O interfaces, determine which sub-component receives input and generates output. A reconfiguration controller switches the virtual multiplexors according to a given reconfiguration schedule or algorithm. The design of a dynamical and partial hardware reconfigurable system is however still not sufficient supported by design tools. To accomplish this, the signal lines for communication with the functionality in the reconfigurable area must be placed at a known position, which can be done by using so called macros

A low jitter delay-locked loop with a realignment duty cycle corrector###In this paper, a new delay-locked loop (DLL) architecture is proposed to effectively improve the DLL jitter performance. A novel realignment duty cycle corrector (RDCC) is proposed for the DLL. The RDCC circuit can make the output waveform of the DLL maintain a 50% duty cycle in a lock mode. The RDCC circuit has advantages of low power consumption, small chip area and high operating frequency. The proposed DLL adopts the clean ref-clock signal and the locked signal to do the "realignment" operation, which improves the jitter performance. The DLL is designed using the TSMC 0.35mum 2P4M CMOS technology. HSPICE simulation results show that the proposed DLL jitter is effectively reduced 61% at 250MHz with a 3.3V supply

Operating system support for dynamically reconfigurable SoC architectures###The advantages and the flexibility introduced into the hardware implementation by partial dynamic reconfiguration have rapidly changed the design flow of embedded systems. Although nowadays it is common to deal with systems characterized by a dynamic architecture able to manage and to adapt themselves to extremely different working scenarios, it is not so easy to provide such flexibility also into the software part of these systems. In order to cope with this problem we developed an innovative modular Linux driver that greatly simplifies the software handling of reconfiguration, allowing the programmer to concentrate on a hierarchical view of the system to be implemented. This methodology can be applied to different architectures providing a powerful and flexible software solution and, at the same time, it can be easily customized to respond to specific behaviors and requirements

Including Power Supply Variations into Static Timing Analysis: Methodology and Flow###In deep sub-micron technologies post-layout tuning analysis has become the most critical phase in the verification of large system-on-chip (SoC) designs with several power-hungry blocks. An increasingly important factor that can introduce a severe performance loss is the power supply noise. As technology advances into the nanometer regime, the operating frequencies increase, and clock gating has emerged as an effective technique to limit the power consumption in block-based designs. As a consequence, the amplitude of the supply voltage fluctuations has reached values where techniques to include the effect of power supply noise into timing analysis based on linear models are no longer adequate, and the non-linear dependence of cell delay from supply voltage must be considered. In this work we present a practical methodology that accurately takes into account the power supply noise effects in static timing analysis, which can be seamlessly included into an industrial sign-off design flow. The experimental results obtained from the timing verification of an industrial SoC design have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach

A highly reconfigurable computing array: DSP plane of a 3D heterogeneous SoC###A 3D heterogeneous system on a chip using a stack of planes has recently been proposed. While the sensors are located on the top plane, the other planes provide for analog processing, digital signal processing, and wireless communication. This paper focuses on a reconfigurable computing array for its DSP plane. The advantages of such an approach are high performance, small area and low power compared to FPGAs, and greater flexibility over ASICs. The authors presented the reconfigurable J-platform, which employs coarse-grain VLSI cells with high functionality, performance, and reconfigurability. These include a universal nonlinear (UNL) cell, an extended multiply accumulate (MA&#095;PLUS) cell, and a data-fabric (DF) cell. The coarse-grain approach has the benefits of reduced external interconnect, much reduced design time, and manageable testability. The paper discusses these cells, including a new concept, namely multi-granularity. The methodology for mapping algorithms is illustrated by two important examples, FIR filtering of signals and images and the independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm. Finally, the paper discusses the issue of defect tolerance, which is critical in attaining reasonable yields making chip manufacture feasible.

Hybrid test data compression technique for SOC scan testing###A hybrid test data compression technique is proposed to reduce the test application time while keeping test power low by assigning "don't cares" to reduce transitions. Initially, test data set is compressed by 0/1 prefix run-length codes. Then, the compressed data are chopped into fixed-length blocks and further encoded by Huffman algorithm. It is observed that the global compression is highly dependent upon the chopping size of initially compressed data upon run-length codes. Since the actual Huffman codes make use of a very small portion of the complete coding space, the decoding logic of our hybrid scheme can be implemented with a very small area penalty. The experiments show significant data compression compared with state-of-the-art techniques

Improving Error Resilience for Compressed Test Sets by Don't Care Assignment###Error-resilience is related to the capability of a compressed test data stream (which is transferred from an automatic test equipment (ATE) to the device-under-test (DUT)) to tolerate bit-flips. The bit-flips may occur in an ATE in the electronics components of the loadboard. As reported in (Hashempour et al., 2005), 10%-30% loss in the fault coverage of compressed test streams can occur due to bit flips for ISCAS89 benchmark circuits. This paper presents a novel technique based on don't care assignment (prior to compression) to improve the error-resilience of a compressed test stream. Experimental results substantiate its effectiveness: fault coverage loss was contained to only 0.5%-6% compared to (Hashempour et al., 2005)

Serial RapidlO: Benefiting System Interconnects###Legacy interconnect technology has proven to be deficient for the complex transactions that occur between system on chip (SoCs) devices in modern embedded systems. The intention of the new serial-based RapidIO interconnect, is to address the needs of embedded applications. This relatively new interconnect technology is poised to lead in this applications space. Embedded systems consist of multiple processing elements, which provide data processing and/or control functions. Some systems may have several thousands of devices that need to intercommunicate. This communication must be reliable, peer-to-peer, low latency, and bandwidth scalable. It must support a wide range of system topologies. Additionally, interconnect must be efficient in the areas of transaction, silicon, and software overhead. RapidIO had the benefit of being designed from the ground up. With this flexibility in mind, the specification targets embedded applications, with primary goals being reliability, efficiency, and protocol flexibility. RapidIO chose a three layered approach based in hardware. The lowest layer is the physical layer, which specifies electrical signaling and link level handshaking mechanisms. The transport layer sits above the physical layer and dictates how packets are routed in the switched environment. Finally, the logical layer is the highest layer which defines packet types and function

On-Chip Power Noise Reduction Techniques in High Performance SoC-Based Integrated Circuits###Switching digital circuits produce current peaks which result in voltage fluctuations on the power supply lines due to the inductive behavior of on-chip and chip-to-package interconnects. A design technique is described in this paper to lower ground bounce in noise sensitive circuits. An on-chip noise-free ground is added to divert ground noise from the sensitive nodes. An on-chip decoupling capacitor tuned in resonance with the parasitic inductance of the interconnects provide an additional low impedance ground path. Ground bounce reductions of about 68% and 22% are demonstrated for a single frequency and random noise, respectively. The noise reduction is shown to depend linearly on the physical separation between the noisy and noise sensitive blocks. The dependence of ground noise on the impedance of the low noise ground is also discussed. The proposed technique exhibits a strong tolerance to capacitance variations. The efficiency of the noise reduction technique drops by several per cent for a plusmn10% variation in the magnitude of the decoupling capacitor. The proposed technique is shown to be effective for both single frequency and random voltage fluctuations on the ground terminal

The proposed flip-flop uses the characteristic of stronger drivability of NMOS transistor than that of transmission gate if the sum of total transistor width is the same. Positive feedback PMOS transistors enhance the speed of the latch as well as guarantee the full-swing of internal nodes. Also, the power consumption of proposed pulsed latch is reduced significantly due to the reduced clock load and smaller total transistor width compared to conventional differential flip-flops. DPTPL reduces EtimesD by 42.1% over modified-SAFF. The simulations were performed in 0.13 mum CMOS technology at 1.2V supply voltage with 1.25GHz clock frequency

To address these problems, this paper describes a hierarchical SIMD (H-SIMD) machine design with its codesign of a hierarchical instruction set architecture (HISA). The proposed H-SIMD design uses an FPGA controller to facilitate ease of program development. It also employs a memory switching scheme to overlap communications with computations as much as possible. The two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (DCT2 or 2D-DCT) is enlisted to show the effectiveness of the H-SIMD machine.

Addressing this issue, this paper presents a low-power power-aware scalable pipelined Booth multiplier that makes use of the sharing common functional unit, ensemble of optimized Wallace-trees and a 4-bit array-based adder-tree for DSP applications. Our multiplier detects the input operands for their dynamic range and accordingly implements a 16-bit, 8-bit or 4-bit multiplication operation. "The multiplication mode is determined by the dynamic-range detection unit, which generates and dispatches the control signals for the pipeline stages. For the 8-bit and 4-bit computations, the proposed Booth multiplier leads to a 29% and 58% power consumption reduction over a non-scalable Booth multiplier, respectively. The proposed scalable pipelined Booth multiplier proves to be globally 20% more power efficient than a non-scalable pipelined Booth multiplier, and also it has fast speed due to pipelining.

The antenna effect is a phenomenon of plasma-induced gate oxide degradation caused by charge accumulation on conductors. It directly influences reliability, manufacturability and yield of VLSI circuits, especially in deep-submicron technology using high density plasma. Furthermore, the continuous increase of the problem size of IC routing is also a great challenge to existing routing algorithms. In this paper, we propose a framework for multilevel full-chip routing with antenna avoidance using built-in jumper insertion approach. Compared with the state-of-the-art multilevel routing, the experimental results show that our approach reduced 100% antenna-violated gates and results in fewer wirelength, vias, and delay increase.

POMR: a power-optimal maze routing methodology###As the number of global interconnect buffers is expected to reach 700,000 in the 70nm CMOS process, their adverse impact on the chip total power consumption becomes evident. In this paper, we formulate the power optimal maze routing and buffer insertion/sizing problem for a two pin net, as a shortest paths ranking problem. The polynomial time bound on our formulation fits well within the context of the increased number of buffers. Moreover, its ability to account for buffer and wire blockage arising from the underlying blocks in today's SOC's is an advantage over the analytical alternative formulations. During the assessment of the impact of technology scaling using a set of MCNC benchmarks, an average power saving as high as 35% with a 10% sacrifice in delay is observed. In addition, there is a 10% variation in the power savings when accounting for the process variations.

Global interconnect optimization with simultaneous macrocell placement and repeater insertion###This paper investigates the problem of global interconnect optimization for intellectual property (IP) based system-on-chip designs. In contrast to previous research, which conducts repeater insertion for global interconnects after the system placement, our approach performs these two steps simultaneously by integrating an interconnect macromodel into the placement procedure. Our macro-model is able to estimate the power dissipation of global interconnects with optimal repeater insertion using the wire length, timing budget, repeater location deviation, and signal activity. Consequently, accurate power dissipation of global interconnects can be used to guide the placement procedure, resulting in high-quality designs. Experimental results have shown that our approach reduces the number of timing-violation paths by more than 80% and achieves up to 11.1% power reduction in comparison with placement schemes based on area or wirelength minimization.

A background calibration scheme for pipelined ADCs including non-linear operational amplifier gain and reference error correction###This paper presents a background noninvasive true calibration technique to correct for nonidealities in pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Pipelined ADC suffers from finite nonlinear gain in amplifiers, ratio mismatch in capacitors, and errors in voltage references. Most calibration schemes do not account for reference voltage errors or nonlinearity in amplifiers, which introduce severe distortion in pipelined ADCs designed in a deep-submicron and nanometer-scale digital CMOS process. The proposed digital calibration scheme uses an insignificant, low-speed, low-power, high-resolution sigma-delta ADC to estimate a set of digital error-correction parameters in background using an adaptive LMS algorithm. The technique is shown to correct all static errors within a single framework - finite amplifier gain, capacitor ratio mismatch, voltage reference errors and amplifier nonlinearity. The scheme is demonstrated for a 14-bit A/D converter intended for speeds higher than 100Msample/s.

Parallel time interleaved delta sigma band pass analog to digital converter for SOC applications###Many system on chip (SOC) architectures are pushing the analog to digital interface into the RF/IF region. A critical component for such architectures is a band pass analog to digital converter (BPADC). A parallel time interleaved (PTI) delta sigma BPADC is presented which supports RF/IF center frequencies for SOC applications. Three low pass delta sigma modulators sampling at 1 GHz are time interleaved to obtain a BPADC with center frequencies of 1 or 2 GHz in 0.18&mu;m CMOS technology. Resolution depends on bandwidth with 8 bits achievable for a 100 MHz bandwidth and 1 GHz sampling frequencies for the modulators. The BPADC center frequencies, resolution, and bandwidth can be modified by changing the sampling frequency of the modulators or the number of modulators that are time interleaved.

Benchmarks for multimedia operations (including MPEG encoding) show that this analysis enables us to improve system performance by 17% with minimum trial-and-error. In addition, it was confirmed that the negative impact on chip area when applying this technique is very small.

An improved delay-hopped transmitted-reference ultra wideband architecture###The delay-hopped transmitted-reference (DHTR) ultra wideband (UWB) architecture was proposed by Hoctor and Tomlinson as a candidate for impulse UWB systems working in multipath fading channels. Compared to the RAKE transceiver, the DHTR transceiver does not require channel estimation, and the correlation can be performed in the analog domain. Since the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are now placed after the correlators, high sampling-rate, high-power ADCs are no longer required. As a result, the DHTR architecture is suitable for low-power, low-data-rate impulse UWB applications, such as RF tagging and sensoring. However, the proposed DHTR architecture will produce discrete spectral spikes in the transmitted signal, which are undesirable because the emissions of the UWB devices are limited by the FCC's regulations. This paper presents a solution to this issue while adding little to the transceiver complexity.

In this paper, a generic low-power and low-voltage VLSI design of a critical-band transform (CBT) processor is proposed. Design and analysis of a 21-band Munich Bark scale CBT processor showed that it can achieve significant power-efficiency by the reduction in computational complexity, implementation of pipeline and parallel processing, and application of supply voltage scaling technique. Simulation results showed that it can complete a CBT analysis (including I/O process) in 4.99ms on one 160-point segment of speech at a very low system clock frequency of 234 kHz. This would support a CBT analysis for 50% overlap 10 ms segments of speech at a sampling frequency of 16 kHz. The power dissipation is 1413.6 &mu;W/MHz and 66.7 &mu;W/MHz for supply voltage of 3.3 V and 1.1 V, respectively.

ChipPower: an architecture-level leakage simulator###Leakage power is projected to be one of the major challenges in future technology generations. The temperature profile, process variation, and transistor count all have strong impact on the leakage power distribution of a processor. We have built a simulator to estimate the dynamic/leakage power for a VLIW architecture considering dynamic temperature feedback and process variation. The framework is based on architecture similar to the Intel Itanium IA64 and is extended to simulate its power when implemented in 65nm technology. Our experimental results show that leakage power will become more than 50% of the power budget in 65nm technology. Moreover, without including the process variation, the total leakage power will be underestimated by as much as 30%.

CoolPression - a hybrid significance compression technique for reducing energy in caches###This paper describes CoolPression, a hybrid hardware-based significance compression technique for reducing energy in caches. The scheme exploits data compression opportunities at bit granularity by employing two compression schemes: a significance compression scheme that counts leading ones and zeros, and a dynamic zero compression technique. Based on actual data, the more energy-efficient scheme is selected dynamically to minimize bitline drives needed for each cache access. Using SPECint2000 benchmark, our experiments show that the CoolPression improves dynamic energy consumption by more than 35% against a baseline cache, while having a saving ranged from 5 to 15% compared to each scheme applied alone.

Extended dynamic voltage scaling for low power design###Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is a popular approach for energy reduction of integrated circuits. Current processors that use DVS typically have an operating voltage range from full to half of the maximum V<sub>dd</sub>. However, it is possible to construct designs that operate over a much larger voltage range: from full Vdd to subthreshold voltages. This possibility raises the question of whether a larger voltage range improves the energy efficiency of DVS. First, from a theoretical point of view, we show that for subthreshold supply voltages leakage energy becomes dominant, making "just in time completion" energy inefficient. We derive an analytical model for the minimum energy optimal voltage and study its trends with technology scaling. Second, we compare several different low-power approaches including MTCMOS, standard DVS and extended DVS to subthreshold operation. Study of real applications on commercial processor shows that extended DVS has the best energy efficiency. Therefore, we conclude that extending the voltage range below V<sub>dd</sub>/2 will improve the energy efficiency for most processor designs.

Power-efficient implementation of turbo decoder in SDR system###Turbo coding is widely used in wireless communication. Efficient implementation of turbo codes has significant impact on the power efficiency of mobile systems. Especially, as the need for software defined radio (SDR) system is growing, the appropriate selection of DSP processors becomes an important design issue. In this work, we show that using a processor that operates using the logarithmic number system is more power efficient for executing the turbo codes than traditional fixed point and floating point processors. Further, we modify the Logarithmic Number System (LNS) processor to support less accurate addition to reduce power consumed by max*, an important operation performed during turbo decoding. Our simulation shows that this optimization reduces the power consumption of turbo coding by 27.6% with negligible impact on the signal to noise ratio.

Achieving higher dynamic range in flash A/D converters###This paper proposes a robust, fault-tolerant scheme to achieve high spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) in an averaging flash A/D converter using comparator chopping. Chopping of all comparators using a novel array of truly binary random number generators is proposed. Chopping randomizes the residual offset left after averaging, further pushing the dynamic range of the converter. Power consumption and area are reduced because of the relaxed design requirements for the same linearity. The technique has been verified for a 6-bit 1Gsample/s flash ADC under case of process gradients with nonzero mean offsets as high as 60m V and potentially serious spot offset errors as high as 1V for a 2V peak to peak input signal. The proposed technique exhibits an improvement of over 15dB compared to pure averaging flash converters for all cases.

Reducing crosstalk noise in high speed FPGAs###Narrowing time-to-market windows are driving the design community toward FPGAs. Whereas quick prototype implementations are possible using FPGAs, circuit delays have always been a major concern. Moreover, achieving high performance in FPGAs with densely packed routing resources is difficult because of crosstalk noise. In this paper we describe a very high performance FPGA, and show a simple and practical technique of almost reducing crosstalk noise by using a two-phase nonoverlapping complimentary clocking scheme. An efficient integer linear programming formulation has been proposed to find an optimum solution to a constrained problem, and we have studied the effects and costs of applying our idea to different architectures. Experiments with MCNC benchmark circuits in different architectures of our FPGA show that, on average, we could reduce crosstalk induced delay increases to less than 4% of the clock period. With a minimal increase of 3% in area due to this optimization, our results seem very promising.

The study targets the development of a SoC platform for the design of next generation network processing. Circuits with an 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and a 64-bit data-path have been implemented and analysed in terms of, scalability, hardware cost, speed, and data throughput capabilities. The circuit analysis is based on performance results with the UMC 0.18 &mu;m standard cell libraries obtained using Synopsys physical compiler. Analysis shows that the 64-bit datapath architecture is able to achieve data rates beyond l0Gbps whereas the 8-bit data-path architecture is very compact and operates with a clock rate of close to 300MHz. Considering the throughput-rate versus silicon area cost as a measure of silicon area efficiency, then the 16-bit data-path architecture proves to be the most efficient.

Application specific instruction memory transformations for power efficient, fault resilient embedded processors###In this paper we present a coding framework for a low energy instruction bus for embedded processors. The encoder exploits application-specific knowledge regarding program hot-spots to generate codewords that deliver savings in power and to furthermore provide concurrent detection of errors. Power savings can be obtained through the use of codewords that reduce the switching activity on the bus. The analysis shows that generating codewords that prohibit the occurrence of three consecutive transitions in three adjacent lines is fundamental to capturing the worst-case crosstalk faults in the bus lines at run time, thus improving the overall reliability of the bus. The desired codewords can be generated through a set of simple prespecified transformations. The detailed analysis we outline shows that the presented transformations are optimal. The proposed encoding scheme is dynamically reprogrammable, thus targeting code particularities effectively. The restriction to a simple yet efficient set of transformations reduces the required storage capacity and eases reprogrammability while achieving these objectives. Extensive experimental analysis on numerical and DSP codes indicates significant improvements in power savings.

Bandgap yield loss due to dislocations on RFSiGe transceiver ICs: failure analysis, design###New design and layout methods were developed to overcome yield loss from dislocation defects, which are omnipresent in SiGe technologies as a penalty for the higher speed compared to pure Si. This paper presents the failure analysis on bandgap malfunctions in a RF-SiGe transceiver device which is currently ramped to production. The resulting yieldloss was significant. In-circuit fault analysis identified collector-emitter leakage of the SiGe-HBT's as the electrical root cause. All existing failure patterns were explained with SPICE circuit simulation. Isolation and characterization of the bipolar transistor and high resolution TEM showed dislocations originating from the high strain at the STI-moat edge. Design and layout improvements were applied to reduce the sensitivity of the bandgap reference circuit to the defects: a 5V HBT with superior yield performance was introduced, and variations in the sizing of the matched npn were investigated. With these improvements, the bandgap fails were drastically reduced.

An efficient error-masking technique for improving the soft-error robustness of static CMOS circuits###Soft-errors are functional failures resulting from the latching of single-event transients (transient voltage fluctuations at a logic node or SETs) caused by electrical noise or high-energy particle strikes. Due to technology scaling and reduced supply voltages, they are expected to increase by several orders of magnitude in logic circuits in the near future. Existing circuit and architectural solutions are inadequate because they have appreciable area/cost, performance, and/or power overheads. We present a very efficient and systematic error-masking technique for static CMOS combinational circuits that prevents an SET pulse, with width, in the worst case, less than approximately half of the timing slack available in its propagation path, from latching and turning into a soft error. The SET is masked without additional delay and within the clock cycle time in an area-efficient manner, which makes this technique applicable to commodity as well as reliability-critical applications. Application of this technique to ISCAS85 benchmark circuits yields average soft-error rate reduction of 75.71% with average area overhead of only 18.14%.

This work presents a method to minimize the maximum simultaneous switching currents in sequential circuits by the seamless integration of the well known techniques of retiming and clock scheduling. We adopt a gradual relaxation based approach to find an efficient solution to our formulation. Experiments with MCNC benchmark circuits in the 0.18 micron technology show that, on average, our method reduces the maximum simultaneous switching current by 18% compared to unoptimized circuits designed using commercial tools. This improvement was obtained with no decrease in operating frequencies. With a reduction of 17% in power dissipation, on average, our method seems encouraging.

An optically differential reconfigurable gate array using a 0.18 &mu;m CMOS process###This paper presents the design of a high-density optically differential reconfigurable gate array (ODRGA) using a 0.18&mu;m-5 metal CMOS process technology. ODRGA is a type of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). However, unlike conventional FPGAs, ODRGAs are reconfigured optically using an external optical system. Although ODRGAs have already been fabricated using a 0.35&mu;m-3 metal CMOS process technology, their gate-density remains unsatisfactory. For that reason, a new ODRGA-VLSI chip with four logic blocks, five switching matrices, and 16 I/O bits was fabricated on a 7.82mm<sup>2</sup> chip using more advanced process technology. This paper presents the detailed design of a fabricated ODRGA-VLSI chip, the optical reconfiguration circuit, the gate array structure, the CAD layout, and an ODRGA-VLSI chip mounted on an estimation board. This study also includes experimental results regarding the reconfiguration period.

Rapid energy estimation of computations on FPGA based soft processors###FPGA based soft processors are an attractive option for implementing embedded applications. As energy efficiency has become a key performance metric, techniques that can quickly and accurately obtain the energy performance of these soft processors are needed. While low-level simulation based on traditional FPGA design flow is too time consuming for obtaining such energy performance, we propose a methodology based on instruction level energy profiling. We first analyze the energy dissipation of various instructions. An energy estimator is built using this information. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, the energy performance of several FFT and matrix multiplication software programs running on a state-of-the-art soft processor is evaluated using the estimator. Compared with the results obtained through low-level simulation, an average estimation error of 5.9% is observed in our experiments.

Analysis and design of low-power multi-threshold MCML###Multi-threshold MOS current mode logic (MTMCML) is a natural evolution for MCML that offers power saving through supply voltage reduction while retaining the same performance. In this work, analytical formulation based on the BSIM3v3 model is proposed for MTMCML with error within 10% compared to HSPICE. The formulation helps designers to efficiently design MTMCML circuits without undergoing the time-consuming HSPICE simulations. Furthermore, it provides design guidelines and aids for designers to fully understand the different tradeoffs in MTMCML design. In addition, the analysis is extended to study the impact of technology scaling and parameter variations on MTMCML. It is shown that the worst case variation in the minimum supply voltage of MTMCML is 1.16%, thus suggesting maximal power saving.

On-chip testing of embedded silicon transducers###System-on-chip (SoC) technologies are evolving towards the integration of highly heterogeneous devices, including hardware of a different nature, such as digital, analog and mixed-signal, together with software components. Embedding transducers, as predicted by technology roadmaps, is yet another step in this continuous search for higher levels of integration and miniaturisation. Embedded transducers fabricated with silicon/CMOS compatible technologies may have more limitations than transducers fabricated with fully dedicated technologies. However, they offer industry the possibility of providing low cost applications for very large market niches, while still keeping acceptable transducer sensitivity. This is the case, for example, for accelerometers, micromirrors display devices or CMOS imagers. Embedded transducers are analog components. But given the fact that they work with signals other than electrical, the test of these embedded parts poses new challenges. Test technology for SoC devices is rapidly maturing but many difficulties still remain, in particular for addressing the test of analog and mixed-signal parts. In this paper, we present our work in the field of MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) on-chip testing with a brief overview of the state-of-the-art.

Fast techniques for standby leakage reduction in MTCMOS circuits###Technology scaling causes subthreshold leakage currents to increase exponentially. Therefore, effective leakage minimization techniques must be designed. In addition, for a true low-power solution in system-on-chip (SoC) design, it has to be tightly integrated into the main design environment. This paper presents two design techniques to effectively solve the sleep transistor sizing and distribution problem in MTCMOS circuits. The introduced first-fit and set-covering approaches achieve lower leakage at an order of magnitude reduction in CPU time compared with other techniques in the literature. In addition, an automatic MTCMOS design environment is developed and integrated into the Canadian Microelectronics Corporation (CMC) digital ASIC design flow.

The circuit is simulated for a threshold voltage mismatch of &plusmn;10%. The simulation results show that the percentage error in the mirrored currents reduced from 48% to 3% for a threshold voltage mismatch of +10% and from 70% to 10% for a threshold voltage mismatch of -10%, for a wide range of input current values. The affect of temperature on the performance of the circuit is studied. The power consumption with and without the compensation transistor is compared. The compensation technique is successfully implemented in a CMOS image sensor.

Analysis and design of monolithic, high PSR, linear regulators for SoC applications###Linear regulators are critical analog blocks that shield a system from fluctuations in supply rails and the importance of determining their power supply rejection (PSR) performance is magnified in SoC systems, given their inherently noisy environments. In this work, a simple, intuitive, voltage divider model is introduced to analyze the PSR of linear regulators, from which design guidelines for obtaining high PSR performance are derived. The PSR of regulators that use PMOS output stages for low drop-out (LDO), crucial for modern low-voltage systems, is enhanced by error amplifiers which present a supply-correlated ripple at the gate of the PMOS pass device. On the other hand, amplifiers that suppress the supply ripple at their output are optimal for NMOS output stages since the source is now free from output ripple. A better PSR bandwidth, at the cost of dc PSR, can be obtained by interchanging the amplifiers in the two cases. It has also been proved that the dc PSR, its dominant frequency breakpoint (where performance starts to degrade), and three subsequent breakpoints are determined by the dc open-loop gain, error amplifier bandwidth, unity-gain frequency (UGF) of the system, output pole, and ESR zero, respectively. These results were verified with SPICE simulations using BSIM3 models for the TSMC 0.35 &mu;m CMOS process from MOSIS.

A new multi-channel on-chip-bus architecture for system-on-chips###We can integrate more IP blocks on the same silicon die as the development of fabrication technologies and EDA tools. Consequently, we can design complicated SoC architecture including multi-processor. However, most of existing SoC buses have bottleneck in on-chip communication because of a shared bus architecture, which results in the performance degradation of the system. In most cases, the performance of multi-processor systems is determined by efficient on-chip communication and the well-balanced distribution of computation rather than the performance of processors. We propose an efficient SoC network architecture (SNA) using crossbar router which provides a solution to ensure enough communication bandwidth. The SNA can significantly reduce the bottleneck of on-chip communication by providing multi-channels. According to the proposed architecture, we design components for the SNA and build a model system. The proposed architecture has a better efficiency by 40% than the AMBA AHB according to a simulation result.

Substrate noise optimization in early floorplanning for mixed signal SOCs###We propose a new approach to substrate noise reduction in early design planning of mixed-signal system-on-chip (MS-SOC). As typical in floorplanning, we assume that no detailed layout information is known for analog and digital blocks. Based on the physics of substrate noise phenomena and extensive noise simulations we propose to represent noise coupling as coupling between large-area (digital) and small-area (analog) substrate noise ports. A separation-dependent noise model for a lightly-doped substrate (preferable for mixed-signal designs) is derived. Our floorplanner reduces the overall noise and the number of analog blocks exceeding their noise limit. Experimental results on examples created from MCNC floorplanning benchmarks are very encouraging.

An adaptive 4-PAM decision-feedback equalizer for chip-to-chip signaling###This paper presents a 4-PAM adaptive decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) for chip-to-chip signaling. The DFE adapts to the channel impulse response by observing a calibration sequence sent across the channel. Uninterrupted signaling is maintained across a parallel bus by providing an additional channel and using multiplexors to reroute the signals of the channel being calibrated. Using the intermittent calibration sequence instead of the conventional LMS adaptation technique removes the need to generate an error signal, eliminating the associated analog blocks. Also presented is a novel method of using the DFE adaptation circuits to extract the system's pulse response. The complete transceiver is implemented in a 0.18 &mu;m CMOS process.

Hurwitz stable model reduction for non-tree structured RLCK circuits [IC interconnect applications]###This paper presents an efficient way to compute the approximate time domain signal waveforms for RLCK circuits that have non-tree or tree-like structures. The new method is based on a graph based approach to drive the transfer function of any linear circuits. Our contribution is the introduction of a Hurwitz approximation to the truncated transfer functions to enforce the stability of the reduced systems. We also extend the direct truncation of the transfer (DTT) technique, which can only work for tree-structured circuits, to deal with non-tree or tree-like RLC circuits. By combining the DTT technique with the graph-based method, we show that the new method is capable of analyzing non-tree or treelike structured RLCK circuits, which are more accurate models of deep submicron high-speed coupled interconnects. The proposed method has been tested and validated on some coupled RLCK circuits.

In addition, the proposed processor satisfies both small area and real-time processing requirement. The gate count of the processor is 37,000 and the number of clock cycles is 640 for a 512-point FFT. Hence, the proposed FFT processor can reduce the gate count and memory size compared with existing FFT processors.

Cost-effective delay-insensitive data transfer mechanism using current-mode multiple valued logic###In this paper, we propose a new data transfer mechanism based on delay-insensitive (DI) data coding with current-mode multiple valued logic (CMMVL). In previous DI data coding, the number of required wires for transferring N-bit data is 2N+1. However, only N+1 wires are needed in our transfer mechanism so it can contribute greatly to reducing the wire cost for designing a large scaled chip. We compare the proposed CMMVL circuit with conventional dual-rail DI encoding to validate its effectiveness through simulation in 0.25 &mu;m CMOS technology. In addition to advantage in wire cost, for 32 bit data transfer, simulation results show that the MVL version is superior to the dual-rail version by about 24.9% in the metric of time-power product. We also apply the MVL version to a practical environment such as an asynchronous bus architecture.

A 8192 complex point FFT/IFFT for COFDM modulation scheme in DVB-T system###In this paper, we propose an implementation method for a single-chip 8192 complex point FFT/IFFT in terms of sequential data processing. In order to reduce the required chip area for the sequential processing of 8 K complex data, a DRAM-based pipelined commutator architecture is used, and this brings 60% chip size reduction over the flip-flop approach. The 8192-point FFT/IFFT consists of cascaded blocks with six stages of radix-4 and one stage of radix-2. Since each stage requires rounding of the resulting bits while maintaining the proper S/N ratio, the convergent block floating point (CBFP) algorithm is used for the effective internal bit rounding. For the IFFT operation, we a use control signal that changes the radix-4 butterfly operator and coefficients saved in ROM without additional blocks. The proposed FFT/IFFT architecture was fabricated using a 0.35 &mu;m standard CMOS process.

High-performance and low-voltage sense-amplifier techniques for sub-90nm SRAM###Large bit-line capacitance is one of the main bottlenecks to the performance of on-chip caches. New sense amplifier techniques need to explicitly address this challenge. This paper describes two sensing techniques to overcome this problem: a current sense amplifier (CSA) and a charge transfer sense amplifier (CTSA) and their implementation based on 90 nm CMOS technology. The current sense amplifier senses the cell current directly and shows a speed improvement of 17-20% for 128 memory cells as compared to the conventional voltage mode sense amplifier, for the same energy. The other is a charge transfer sense amplifier that takes advantage of large bit-line capacitance for its operation. The CTSA shows an improvement of 18-22% for read delay for 128 memory cells and consumes 15-18% less energy than the voltage mode sense amplifier. The CTSA results in reduced bit-line swing, which in turn leads to 30% lower bit-line energy than the conventional voltage mode.

A leakage-tolerant high fan-in dynamic circuit design style [logic circuits]###A leakage-tolerant design technique for high fan-in dynamic logic circuits is presented. An NMOS transistor with gate and drain terminals tied together (diode) is added in series with the evaluation network of standard domino circuits. Due to the stacking effect, the leakage of the evaluation path significantly decreases, thereby improving the robustness of the circuit against deep-submicron subthreshold leakage and input noise. To improve the speed of the circuit, a current mirror is also employed in the evaluation network to increase the evaluation current. The proposed technique (diode-footed domino) exhibits considerable improvement in leakage and noise-immunity as compared to the standard domino circuits.

Energy recovery design for low-power ASICs###Three decades ago, theoretical physicists suggested that the controlled recovery of charges could result in electronic circuitry whose power dissipation approaches thermodynamic limits, growing at a significantly slower pace than the fCV<sup>2</sup> rate for CMOS switching power. Early engineering research in this field, which became generally known as adiabatic computing, focused on the asymptotic energetics of computation, exploring VLSI designs that use reversible logic and adiabatic switching to preserve information and achieve nearly zero power dissipation as operating frequencies approach zero. Recent advances in CMOS VLSI design have taken us to real working chips that rely on controlled charge recovery to operate at substantially lower power dissipation levels than their conventional counterparts. Although their origins can be traced back to the early adiabatic circuits, these so-called energy-recovering systems approach charge recycling from a more practical angle, achieving operating frequencies in the hundreds of MHz with relatively low overhead. Among other energy recovering designs, researchers in the field have demonstrated microcontrollers, standard-cell ASICs, SRAMs, LCD panel drivers, I/O drivers, and multi-GHz clock networks. In this tutorial, we present an overview of the field, focusing on the most promising charge recovering design techniques for ASICs that are close to integration into the field.

An access pattern based energy management strategy for instruction caches###Increasing leakage energy consumption is an important problem for SOC-based platforms as such platforms rely on large on-chip SRAMs. While most of the previous techniques focus on hardware based leakage optimization, in this paper, we present an application access pattern oriented strategy for reducing instruction cache leakage energy. This strategy keeps track of the dynamic transitions between the procedures of a given application, and tries to keep the cache lines not used by the current procedure in a power-down state as much as possible. Our simulation results indicate significant savings in leakage energy.

Fast and energy-efficient asynchronous level converters for multi-VDD design [CMOS ICs]###Multi-VDD design effectively reduces power consumption but the need for level conversion imposes delay and energy penalties, limiting the potential gains. In this work, we describe new level converting circuits that consume 8-50% less energy at equivalent or better speeds compared to those available in the literature. We suggest that level converters should be evaluated largely by maximum speed as slower level converters waste valuable timing slack that can be used to reduce total system energy. Based on this metric, the new structures offer up to 17% faster operation than conventional designs. We also propose embedding functionality into level converters. For typical values of the low VDD, this technique can reduce delay by 15% at constant energy or lower energy by up to 30% at fixed delay.

De-synchronization: asynchronous circuits from synchronous specifications###This paper presents an EDA methodology that can be used to realize asynchronous circuits using conventional EDA tools and conventional technology libraries, starting from a synchronous synthesizable specification. It provides the key advantages of asynchronous implementation, i.e. low power and low EMI, at a reasonable cost in terms of area and performance, without requiring any change in the specification or in most of the flow. Only a tool that replaces the clock tree with simple asynchronous controllers is required. The controllers are implemented using the direct-mapped approach, whereas datapaths are implemented using conventional synthesis and matched delay elements. The methodology is analyzed using a case study implementing several versions of asynchronous DES encryption cores.

Clocking for correct functionality on wave pipelined circuits###Wave pipelining is a method of speeding up the circuit design without the insertion of registers. This reduces the overhead related to clocking significantly and allows for better temporal logic utilization. However, because of the fact there are no intermediate registers, the clocking of wave pipelined circuits becomes more delicate and very susceptible to delay changes due to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations. With the traditional method of pipelining, it becomes just a problem of frequency adjustment, but, with wave pipelining, it becomes a more difficult problem due to more complicated constraints involving clock frequency and skew. In this paper, we look at some of the prior works done in this area, and introduce a localized clock circuitry scheme to address this issue.

Robust and efficient dynamic voltage scaling architecture [microprocessor based systems]###An efficient dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) architecture to track process and temperature, based on a lookup table, is presented. If environmental conditions change faster than the DVS system can track, the supply voltage must be raised to satisfy the worst case process and temperature conditions. In the proposed system, an efficient method of identifying the process is used, independent of temperature conditions. Voltage can be adjusted, based on the split information extracted. The proposed system can achieve up to 29% energy savings compared to the conventional system.

This logic can implement a complex function in a single gate. The CLDL circuit utilizes a charge-redistribution and reduced-swing scheme to reduce the power dissipation. In addition, a pipeline structure is formed by a series connection structure controlled by a true-single-phase clock, thereby achieving high-speed operation. A pipelined multiplier-accumulator (MAC) and an 8 bit synchronous counter, using the CLDL structure, were designed in a standard 0.35 &mu;m CMOS process.

The expression shows the parameters that affect the delay. Based on the obtained expression, a design approach is devised that leads to minimum power dissipation in MOS current mode logic gates for a given gate delay and load. This approach can serve as the basis for an automated methodology to size power efficient MCML gates that are extensively used in integrated optical transceivers.

Increasing complexity and increasing impact of interconnects to integrated circuit (IC) performance makes 3D more and more attractive. EDA tools for 3D design hardly exist. We propose a new 3D standard-cell placer based on quadratic programming. It ensures a reduction of the total wirelength and can deal with standard cells and vertical interconnects simultaneously. The final result is a legalized, design rule compliant and discrete 3D placement.

Low power instruction fetch using profiled variable length instructions###Computer system performance depends on high access rate and low miss rate in the instruction cache, which also affects energy consumed by fetching instructions. Simulation of a small computer typical for embedded systems shows that up to 20% of the overall processor energy is consumed in the instruction fetch path and as much as 23% of the execution time is spent on instruction fetch. Therefore it is of key importance to reduce the energy dissipated during instruction fetch. One way to increase the instruction memory bandwidth is to fetch more instructions in each access without increasing the bus width. We propose an extension to a RISC ISA, with variable length instructions, yielding higher information density without compromising programmability. Based on profiling of dynamic instruction usage and argument locality of a set of SPEC CPU2000 applications, we present a scheme using 816- and 24-bit instructions accompanied by lookup tables inside the processor Our scheme yields a 20-30% reduction in main memory usage, and experiments show that up to 60% of all executed instructions consist of short instructions. The overall energy savings are up to 15% for the entire data path and memory system, and up to 20% in the instruction fetch path.

We show that by adopting a smart bypassing strategy we can enhance the effectiveness of a code cache based system significantly.

New trends in low power SoC design technologies###Summary form only given. The growing complexity of system-on-chip (SoC) continues to advance the concept of low power devices/circuits/architectures/algorithms co-design. This requires the close interaction among various disciplines to be involved in the development of low power high performance computer, communication and consumer SoC applications. The design of low power wireless mobile SoC products now must equally concern itself with digital and analog mixed-signal devices and circuits, interconnection wires and nano-scale CMOS technology. The reduction of the power consumption in low voltage circuits is necessary to reduce the leakage power in both the active and standby modes of operation. The reduction in leakage current in design has to be achieved using circuit-level and physical-layout techniques. This tutorial paper first considers major circuit techniques and then considers physical-layout techniques for leakage control and reduction. This paper also considers voltage island techniques, concurrent mixed-signal semi-custom design methodology, dual-supply techniques for regular logic fabric VPGA and cache memory, system-level power management, and silicon-implementation platform design.

Low power SOC in deep-submicron era###Summary form only given. As system-on-chip (SOC) technology advances, it is becoming possible to integrate all processing elements into a single SOC, including basic transistors/gates, various processor cores, memory cells, and analog macros. Today is truly an SOC era, where SOC designers must consider not only HW design, but also SW design. In the history of SOC technology, there has been a prominent improvement toward reducing operating power by means of decreasing feature size and lowering operating voltage. But, it seems that there is a physical limitation to reducing stand-by current, which is crucial for mobile devices, while maintaining performance. In the area of mobile SOC design with deep-submicron technology, it becomes a complex task to simultaneously pursue the two goals of improving the performance and reducing stand-by current. In this tutorial, we introduce and evaluate a variety of methodologies to achieve a low power and high performance SOC design.

Intelligent energy management<sup>TM</sup> for portable embedded systems###Summary form only given. One of today's most successful embedded devices, the mobile phone, embodies a set of challenging design requirements: week-long battery life, small size, high performance, and low cost. The single parameter that complicates the simultaneous fulfillment of all of these design goals is power consumption. To address these concerns, systems must be optimized for power during design and also at run-time. The key to taking advantage of the performance-power trade-off is the use of algorithms that aim to reduce the processor's performance level when it is not critical to meet the application's deadlines. The central issue is how the right level of performance can be predicted for applications. The intelligent energy management (IEM) framework provides an integrated solution for addressing power management of SoC devices: 1) EDA methodology for using soft-IP in multiple frequency- and voltage-domain designs; 2) open- and closed- loop control of the power supply for efficient operation; 3) architectural abstraction for controlling the processor's performance levels; and 4) software algorithms for deriving the minimum sufficient performance for running dynamic workloads.

Fast and practical false-path elimination method for large SoC designs###In this paper, we propose a new fast and practical technique to eliminate known false paths during static timing analysis (STA). False paths are verified fast using additional information stored in arrival times, which is a pass-through history of exceptional nodes. The information can be constructed with small memory overhead because an individual false path list is not managed at each arrival time. We adapted this method to classical arrival time computation and a critical path searching algorithm. The feature is used in CubicTime, our full-chip gate level static timing analyzer, supporting multiple clock domains. We describe the details of our algorithm and the experimental results compared to those of our previous method and a de-facto industry-standard STA tool.

An advanced cell polynomial-base modeling for logic synthesis###This paper presents an advance cell modeling technique based on the polynomial expressions for physical and logic design. Till now, there lacks a modeling method to handle multiple operating points such as input slew, output capacitance, voltage, process, temperature, etc. at one time for the logic synthesis and physical design. Our novel curve-fitting algorithm for cell modeling can process a table with thousands of data points in only one modeling equation compared to piecewise equations used in the existing methods. The data storage requirements and CPU run time are significantly reduced without compromising the accuracy of the data. This ensures that the novel curve-fitting algorithm can exactly recover the original data points in a short period of time. In addition, the table-partitioning algorithm is developed to reduce the storage requirements and flatten the peak situation occurring at some of the unsampled data. Furthermore, in order to filter the 'pass' points with 99% of all data points, the algorithm is developed to select the best order for input variables, which further causes a shortening of the CPU run time. Our benchmark shows that the new approach has significantly better accuracy and less storage for both the sampling data and unsampling data.

Low power VLSI implementation of the map decoder for turbo codes through forward recursive calculation of reverse state metrics###Memory utilization is a vital issue in the implementation of the MAP algorithm. The MAP decoder operating in the log domain requires either the forward or the backward path metrics to be stored before finally calculating the log-likelihood decisions. This process consumes large amount of memory. In this paper, we present a reduced complexity version of a technique which computes the reverse state metrics in the forward direction and hence reduces the required memory size. A low power VLSI architecture of a log-MAP decoder employing this technique is presented. We provide results which demonstrate that the proposed design reduces the memory size and hence reduces the power consumption by 35%.

Aspects and implications of system-on-a-chip communication circuits on future device and nanotechnology development###The projected complexity of future generation communication systems can be briefly defined as spectacular. Developing a technology and the associated devices to optimally implement such a communication system is a highly challenging and costly task. The risk is also considerable, and consists in finding the right path that will lead to the optimal results with a minimal cost. There are many aspects to be considered, but, a fundamental one is to find the optimal device characteristics that meet simultaneously the high-level circuit/system requirements. A customizable methodology to derive a device specification, starting from high-level circuit and system metrics, is proposed. Specifically, power dissipation aspects and their implications on the device characteristics are discussed.

DOMINO noise model: a new crosstalk noise model for dynamic logic circuits###DOMINO gates are more vulnerable to crosstalk-induced functional failures compared to static CMOS gates. Previously developed noise models generate a pessimistic noise analysis because the effect of the keeper in DOMINO is not properly incorporated. In this paper, a new crosstalk noise model is proposed for DOMINO logic gates. Our noise model takes the effect of the keeper into account and provides a more accurate noise measure. We define the degree of conservatism for noise models and show that our noise model dramatically reduces the pessimism.

Current status and challenges of SoC verification for embedded systems market###The SoC has become an indispensable solution in the embedded systems market. This tutorial introduces today's main issues of SoC design with a focus on the verification solutions proposed by EDA vendors and SoC developers. After the SoC platform based on several embedded cores is fixed, design efforts are focused on the verification of peripheral IPs and debugging of the software in the context of the platform. For IP verification, formal methods are first used when applicable and suitable to statically remove design bugs and improve coverage, and test-bench automation tools are applied to test the IP with realistic test vectors. Finally, all the IPs are mapped in FPGA in the emulator, to be verified in the real operating environment. For integrated system verification, the emulation environment is set up as soon as the platform is selected and the block-level partitioning is done. A well-established emulation platform helps progressive refinement of newly added SoC components and early development and verification of the software.

Interconnect-driven multistage hierarchical floorplanning for soft modules###In this paper, we present a new multistage hierarchical floorplanning algorithm for soft modules integrated with fast but effective interconnect-driven module placement and hierarchical chip area minimization. The interconnect-driven module placement is achieved by using a fast cell-filling algorithm based on the interconnection relation of nets. Using the topology of module locations built by our cell-filling algorithm, a hierarchical chip area minimization algorithm, based on non-linear programming, is applied to minimize the total chip area. In addition, critical paths, or the connective strength of critical nets, could be easily enhanced during the step of analyzing interconnection relations for solving timing closure problems. Experimental results show that our multistage hierarchical approach can minimize chip area and total wire length simultaneously in a very efficient way.

Tile-based power planning during floorplanning###In this paper, we introduce a tile-based approach to power planning at the stage of floorplanning. For a given floorplan solution, an associated tile graph of power density is generated, and the temperature of the floorplan is evaluated tile by tile. In contrast to the direct evaluation from the power consumption of circuit blocks and neglecting the effect of heat diffusion, we take the effect of heat diffusion in a die into consideration. Also, we simplify the computing of temperature by way of a tile graph, which make the heat estimation and thus the power planning in the floorplanning stage possible.

Compact physical models for multilevel interconnect crosstalk in a gigascale SoC###For the first time, compact physical models are derived for multilevel interconnect crosstalk that is induced by inter and intra-level near and far aggressors. It is shown that there is a trade-off between crosstalk and latency, and crosstalk can be prohibitively large if interconnects operate in the deep RLC region. Repeater insertion is an effective way to simultaneously lower crosstalk and increase wiring density with no significant increase in latency.

An efficient approach for reducing inductive noise using shield insertion [IC layout]###An efficient technique to reduce the inductive noise is to insert shields among signal wires. These shields are quiet wires that are either connected to the ground or to the power supply. An efficient approach to determine the locations and number of shields needed to satisfy certain noise constraints is provided. We use an already existing noise model, which is flexible and fast, to be included in the core of our algorithm. Experimental results and SPICE simulations show that our approach is fast compared to the best-known approach and needs few number of shields to satisfy the noise constraints.

Area minimization of clock distribution networks using local topology modification###The quality of the clock distribution networks (CDNs) impacts the performance of an SoC. In this paper, we propose local topology modification (LTM) in order to enhance the CDN's quality in terms of total wire length and wire elongations. The incorporation of this method into a deferred-merge embedding algorithm (DME) and greedy-DME (GDME) reduces the total wire length by around 7.83% and 9.77% respectively, with a slight increase in run time. In addition, we show that GDME relies intensively on wire elongations and it offers a solution that suffers from high standard deviation of the path lengths between clock pins and the CDN's root (SDPL). Applying LTM to GDME reduces wire elongations and SDPL by 96.4 % and 51.5 % respectively.

Analysis of soft error rate in flip-flops and scannable latches###Soft errors can be induced through radiation sources, with particles of low energy occurring far more frequently than particles of high energy. Therefore, smaller CMOS device are more easily affected by lower energy particles. Thus, soft errors are gaining importance as technology scales. Flip-flops, an important component of pipelined architectures, are becoming more susceptible to soft errors. This work analyzes soft error rates on a variety of flip-flops. The analysis was performed by implementing and simulating various designs in 70 nm, 1 V CMOS technology. First, we evaluate the critical charge for the susceptible nodes in each design. Further, we implement two hardening techniques and present the results. One attempts to increase the gate capacitance, the other improves the overall robustness of the circuit by replicating the master stage of the master-slave flip-flops, which leads to reduced power and area overhead.

A high dynamic range CMOS image sensor design based on two-frame composition###In this paper, we present a CMOS image sensor design with a high dynamic range. This feature is achieved by a two-frame scheme, in which an image is captured twice with different sensitivity levels. One of them focuses on the low light intensity part of the image, while the other focuses on the high light intensity part. After proper composition, these two frames are then combined as a single image with a higher dynamic range. The proposed scheme is a low-cost solution in the sense that it can be built on top of any traditional sensor design with only minor modification made to the on-chip controller. A simulation environment with post-layout accuracy is used to demonstrate the effectiveness. It shows that a number of pictures, e.g., the one of fireworks, can be captured more clearly than a traditional sensor.

An efficient implementation of the InfiniBand link layer###InfiniBand is a new system interconnection protocol that provides high bandwidth, expandability, and scalability. This paper presents the design and implementation of the link layer of an InfiniBand HCA (host channel adapter). Six VLs (virtual lanes), three for transmit and three for receive, are employed to communicate data between the transport layer and the link layer. For the efficient implementation of the receiver logic, a high-speed packet buffering architecture with a novel FIFO circuit is proposed. The new architecture enables the efficient utilization of the InfiniBand bandwidth and the reduction of hardware cost as well as power consumption. The implemented link layer core is employed by an InfiniBand HCA chip called KINCA that complies with InfiniBand protocol v1.0a and is fabricated with the UMC 0.18 &mu;m process.

These segments are asynchronous point-to-point interconnects separated by identical self-timed transfer stages. Each system module accesses the ring via a transfer stage, and bus arbitration and control is distributed among the stages. According to simulations, using a 0.18 &mu;m technology, the overall maximum performance varied between 4.9 and 6.6 Gword/s depending on the communication pattern and the ring topology.

Second, we demonstrate with the example of a distributed transmission line how to model PDEs in an existing VHDL-AMS by applying spatial discretization to system equations. Third, we propose a language extension needed to support PDEs. Our work should be perceived as a first step towards an accurate description and modeling of coupled multiphysics systems in VHDL-AMS.

Pipelined interconnect free logic###The pipelined interconnect free (PIF) logic is a novel design paradigm shift that has the potential of eliminating several problems that are currently constraining the digital design community. Since interconnects, and not gates have become the bottleneck in deep sub-micron technology, it makes sense to find an alternative to todays interconnects. We propose to replace interconnects of non-adjacent gate cells with chains of gates. However, the new type of design is more than a mere replacement of interconnects with gates. As demonstrated with a PIF logic based 64 bit adder example, the new design becomes a well-structured design with predictable delays. In contrast, in a conventional design, lack of accurate interconnect delay values force more pessimistic constraints to be applied to the design.

SiGe BiCMOS PAM-4 clock and data recovery circuit for high-speed serial communications###A multilevel clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit for highspeed serial data transmission was designed using the IBM 6 HP 0.25 &mu;m SiGe BiCMOS process technology. The circuit extracts the clock from a 32 Gb/s 4-level pulse amplitude modulated (PAM-4) input signal and outputs four channels of retimed NRZ data at 8 Gb/s per channel. The CDR design incorporates a PAM-4 to 2-bit-binary converter, a phase/frequency detector, a loop filter, a quadrature LC ring oscillator and a data-retiming module. The circuit operates using a 3.3 V supply voltage with a 350 mA current consumption. The simulation results show that the peak-to-peak jitter is 1.3 ps, the capture range is 2 GHz, the acquisition time is 200 ns and the input sensitivity is 150 mV. This PAM-based CDR technique is quite suitable for low-loss transmission channels such as fiber optic communications or short-distance copper links, including network-on-chip (NOC) implementations and storage area networks (SANs).

From the number of errors, the level of substrate noise is estimated using the probabilistic approach. This type of detector is useful in that it monitors substrate noise in real-time. Using this, various adaptive algorithms become feasible to reduce substrate noise. The details of the detector circuits are presented.

NC-SRAM - a low-leakage memory circuit for ultra deep submicron designs###In this paper, we present a novel N-controlled SRAM (NC-SRAM) design for reducing the subthreshold leakage in cache and embedded memories using a dual-V<sub>t</sub> process. We combine the use of high V<sub>t</sub> transistors in the leakage path and gating the supply voltage to reduce leakage in unused SRAM cells. This circuit-level technique overcomes the potential limitations in the existing techniques for reducing leakage in memory circuits. In this design, the data stored in the cell is retained even when the memory is put in the stand-by mode, with no additional complexity or circuit overhead. Simulation results indicate that NC-SRAM has better leakage savings as compared to other techniques. In addition, our results on 100 nm and 70 nm processes show 21% and 18% reduction in total power and 77% and55 % reduction in leakage power, respectively, with very minimal impact on performance and area, as compared to a conventional 6T-SRAM.

DES-SRAM IP-core: a SRAM embedding DES feature [secure SoC applications]###This paper proposes a DES-SRAM IP-core dedicated to secure SoCs. This core is an optimized hardware implementation of a DES (data encryption standard) secret key algorithm. The main idea was to implement a DES feature inside a basic SRAM in order to suppress data transfers during data encryption and thus to avoid a bus bottleneck as well as to increase SoC security. The DES capability only adds few percent hardware overhead, and our modified SRAM offers two operating modes: a basic SRAM mode and an encryption mode. The DES-SRAM self-encrypts each 64 bit block of its own data in 17 clock cycles.

Optimal multilevel interconnect architecture aspect ratios for GSoCs###A methodology for optimal design of the reverse-scaled interconnect stack is used to optimize the interconnect cross-sectional aspect ratios to increase performance or reduce area. For a 100 nm generation macrocell in a GSI system-on-a-chip (GSoC), using an optimal aspect ratio is demonstrated to achieve 40% increase in clock frequency or 53% decrease in macrocell area. The effects of inductance and repeater insertion on the optimum aspect ratio are illustrated using a case study from the 45 nm technology generation. Comparison with a commercial 130 nm process generation shows good matching with the model predictions for the aspect ratios of the upper metal levels, while recommendations are suggested for a better design of the lower metal levels.

FVP: a formal verification platform for SoC###How to verify a system-on-a-chip (SoC) has been an important issue in the SoC design process due to its complexity. The capacity of traditional verification techniques such as simulation or emulation is no longer suitable for SoCs. However, formal verification that provides 100% coverage and counterexamples is expected to be a complementary solution. Several researches on formally verifying an SoC have demonstrated its feasibility and benefits. Nevertheless, there is no utility for platform-based formal verification of SoCs as yet. A formal verification platform (FVP) is proposed to formally verify an intellectual property (IP) by providing a formal platform to create its environment. We illustrate our modeling experiences using the model checker SGM.

By combining a standard synchronous on-chip bus architecture with GALS methodology, the advantage of a high-bandwidth low-latency system bus and independent clock domains for peripheral modules is achieved. The peripheral modules are still allowed to have continuous clocks and operate as in a standard synchronous environment. The solution is tested in an existing AMBA based simulation testbed, and correct behavioral functionality is confirmed.

A RT level verification method for SoC designs###In SoC design, several system level architectural alternatives may be explored if the custom-logic blocks (CLB) in the system could be readily tuned to meet different constraints imposed by each candidate system architecture. A set of RTL designs, each distinct in terms of major cycles required, operation schedule, and resource utilization, may be generated using high-level synthesis for each CLB. The designer, however must ascertain that these RTLs are equivalent. We present a novel RTL technique to establish such equivalence regardless of the high-level synthesis methods and constraints, enabling SoC architecture exploration.

System-on-chip choices [RISC or DSP solution]###For many years the decision between a RISC or DSP solution was relatively simple as RISCs and DSPs were never integrated on the same device. The rule used was an 80/20 rule. That is, if the greater part of the processing (i.e., 80 percent) is for data, then attempt to do the signal processing on the RISC. If the greater portion of the processing (i.e., 80 percent) is for signals, attempt to do the data processing on the DSP. But with the ability to integrate both RISCs and DSPs onto the same piece of silicon, the choice becomes more complex. With the addition of programmable accelerators, ASIC and FPGAs also integrated on the same piece of silicon, the choices become almost impossible. The correct choice is not always based on a technical basis. The decisions truly become an optimization of flexibility, ease of use, cost, power and performance. Simply put, the winning strategy is to find a solution which has good enough performance, low enough power dissipation, and low enough price to be first to market. This strategy is referred as a P<sup>3</sup> strategy. This paper outlines a concept to help system designers selecting the right SOC architecture and optimizing the performance by allocating the right tasks to the right processor.

A hierarchical partitioning algorithm for VLSI designs###A hierarchical partitioning algorithm (HPA) partitions a circuit to several physical blocks while maintaining the logical hierarchy of the circuit. It uses a cost function which combines the net-cut, path-weight, and area of each module. A dynamic programming-based approach is utilized to find the minimal cost for different numbers of partitions. The area constraint helps the HPA to obtain area-balanced partitioning results in a shorter CPU time. The program has been tested on several industrial circuits. Experimental results are presented.

We have simulated the proposed equalizers using the Cadence&reg; SPW&trade; CAD tool. The architecture has been modeled by VHDL and logic synthesis has been performed using the 0.25 &mu;m Faraday library. The total gate count of the proposed equalizer is about 190,000 and the operating frequency is 15 MHz. The proposed equalizers provide a symbol rate up to 64 Mbps.

Efficient bit-oriented implementation of FIR filter using a new compressor###In this paper, we present a bit-oriented architecture for the digital finite impulse response (FIR) filter with adaptive coefficients. Instead of using multipliers, the FIR operation is regarded as the summation of a larger number of operands. Our architecture utilizes a new compressor called the six-to-triple compressor, which converts six data bits of equal weights into a triple-digit representation. Using such a compressor as the basic building block, an FIR can be implemented as an efficient and regular structure that lends itself to automation. Experiments show that the proposed architecture could achieve a 28.4 % reduction on the area-delay product as compared to the traditional high-speed transposed form for an FIR design.

A sixth-order continuous-time quadrature bandpass sigma-delta modulator for UMTS low-IF receivers and a study of the inherent excess loop delay effect###The first continuous-time (CT) quadrature bandpass &Sigma;&Delta; modulator with a sixth-order architecture is presented. It provides a signal bandwidth of 3.84 MHz (according to the universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) standard), centered at a low-IF of 4 MHz, and achieves a simulated peak signal-to-noise-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 78.3 dB and a dynamic range (DR) of 78.6 dB at a clock frequency of 96 MHz. Furthermore, the excess loop delay effect is studied. This effect is one of the main problems in CT &Sigma;&Delta; modulators. Previously presented papers investigate this effect for CT lowpass and bandpass &Sigma;&Delta; modulators and for a second-order CT quadrature bandpass &Sigma;&Delta; modulator. This paper, however, analytically describes and simulates the excess loop delay effect for the high-order CT quadrature bandpass &Sigma;&Delta; modulator with a sixth-order architecture.

We propose an integrated gate-sizing and buffer insertion layout-aware approach to spread out the switching times of the gates in a circuit, and thus reduce SSN. We have efficiently formulated our problem as a linear programming one, achieving improvements of 12-14 %, on average, in the peak-peak current swing values over the original circuit implementations.

LP/LV ratioed DG-SOI logic with (intrinsically on) symmetric DG-MOSFET load###Summary form only given. Over the last several years there has been a great deal of excitement about the double-gate (DG) SOI MOSFET as the enabling Si device for the 0.05 &mu;m node and beyond. As a result a number of DG structures have been proposed and analyzed, and several have been experimentally demonstrated. Although these devices are currently being vigorously researched and evolving, most structures are commonly categorized as symmetric (SDG), where both gates are made of the same polysilicon type (usually n<sup>+</sup>) and asymmetric (ADG), where one gate is n<sup>+</sup> and the other p<sup>+</sup> type polysilicon. The n<sup>+</sup> gate SDG is a "normally on" device (negative threshold voltage), and for this and other reasons the favor is currently with the ADG device, although metal gates of appropriate workfunction values are being considered to fine-tune the SDG device. Rather than modify the SDG device at the expense of complicated processing, the authors seek to investigate the possibility of using this intrinsically on structure as a load device for DG-SOI based ratioed logic, with ADG drivers.

Digitally controlled high-voltage analog switch array for medical ultrasound applications in thin-layer silicon-on-insulator process###We present a high-voltage bi-directional analog switch array designed and fabricated in thin-layer silicon-on-insulator technology for medical ultrasound applications. Thin-layer high-voltage SOI technology provides a factor-of-three reduction in specific on-resistance and capacitance over bulk silicon technologies (Letavic et al., Proc. IEEE ISPSD'97, pp. 49-52, 1997), resulting in substantial miniaturization of analog switch array function and inherently high performance. The integrated circuit contains five &plusmn;100 V 20 &Omega; bi-directional switches, including integrated gate drive, level shifting, and digital control in a total area of less than 6.5 mm<sup>2</sup>. On-state power dissipation is measured at 15.7 mW at 50 kHz switch toggle, with -52 dB of off-state isolation in a 50 &Omega; load. This represents at least a factor-of-two increase in density for high-voltage analog switch arrays, and the resultant low-dissipation and miniaturization provides new system options for high performance 3D medical ultrasound applications.

Hot-carrier-induced degradation on 0.1 &mu;m SOI CMOSFET###For BC-SOI nMOSFET, higher valence-band electron tunneling leading to maximum hot-carrier-induced I<sub>Dsat</sub> degradation on V<sub>G</sub>=V<sub>D</sub>. But for FB-SOI nMOSFET, initial I<sub>Dsat</sub> degradation is enhanced by PBT when V<sub>G</sub>&sim;V<sub>T</sub>. The maximum I<sub>Dsat</sub> degradation occurs at V<sub>G</sub>=V<sub>D</sub> due to electron tunneling. FB-SOI devices were inversely temperature-dependent compared to BC-SOI devices. For pMOSFET, the impact ionization was not obvious due to lower channel hole mobility, thus the maximum I<sub>Dsat</sub> degradation occurred for V<sub>G</sub>=V<sub>D</sub> for both SOI pMOSFETs.

This paper focusses on the challenges encountered with SOI wafers in terms of small defect detection and sizing accuracy. Inspection strategy with the latest generation inspection tool is also discussed in order to close the gap between actual production and industry requirements.

Based on the study, with a higher k gate dielectric, the subthreshold slope is less steep due to the reduced potential barrier in the surface channel caused by a larger vertical electric field in the LDD region under the sidewall oxide spacer next to the drain.

A reduced clock swing domino gate in SOI###The authors have introduced a domino gate that operates at a reduced clock swing. Using a DTMOS, the performance degradation is minimal while the total power consumption is greatly reduced since the clock tree has a halved voltage swing. Due to the squared relationship between voltage and power, 75% saving can be obtained on a clock whose contribution can be up to 50% of the overall power consumption. The use of active body-biasing circuits yields an order of magnitude reduction of the gate leakage power dissipation.

Scaling assessment of fully-depleted SOI technology at the 30 nm gate length generation###Thin-film SOI MOSFETs are of interest for scaling devices down into the deep-submicron region due to their ability to reduce short-channel effects (SCE). While double-gate MOSFET is currently considered the most promising candidate for CMOS scaled beyond the 20-30nm limit, we investigate the single-gated SOI MOSFET scalability at the 30nm gate length generation. We have examined their electrostatic behavior using the drift-diffusion ISE DESSIS device simulator. An internally developed quantum transport simulator was also used to confirm the DESSIS simulation trend and assess the impact of thin silicon film on SCE. The device under study has mid-gap workfunction gate material, undoped channel and 15&Aring; gate oxide thickness. This device presents the strongest scaling potential due to the high mobility from the absence of ionized doping impurities, suppression of dopant fluctuation effects and reduced threshold voltage variation with silicon film thickness. We have studied the impact of the silicon film thickness, BOX and front gate dielectric thickness and k values on the short-channel performance of the device. The ground plane structure was also simulated for comparison. We show that extremely thin silicon film thickness around 3nm would be necessary to meet the low-power applications 1999 ITRS specifications at the 50nm technology node. The quantum mechanical effects at this silicon film thickness become dominant, preventing the FDSOI technology to be scaled down to 30nm and beyond.

Partial SOI/SON formation by He<sup>+</sup> implantation and annealing###We fabricated partial SOI/SON structures by light-ion implantation (LII) technique. Compared with the patterned SIMOX, the LII technique causes less damage, and therefore can reduce defect density at the pattern edge of the partial SOI structure. Partial SON formed by LII shows further reduction in the defect density, probably because the stress induced by the SiO<sub>2</sub> formation is small. The SON surface is extremely smooth. Thus, the LII has great advantages for partial SOI/SON fabrication as a substrate for SOC.

A new structure for in-depth history effect characterization on partially depleted SOI transistors###As partially depleted SOI technology becomes very attractive for ULSI CMOS, an in-depth characterization of floating body (FB) effects is required, especially for circuit design. One of the most important FB effects is the history effect, i.e. the propagation delay variation versus time. Many publications have shown experimental and simulation analysis of those effects. Most of the time, the experimental analysis of the history effect is done through chains, from which the propagation delay is extracted. In this paper, we propose a new structure that enables us to do an in-depth characterization of history effect, distinguishing between pull-up and pull-down delays for the first and second switches.

Both elements affect the lateral bipolar induced charge dump current during pass gate transient operation. Increase in the gate tunneling current and reduction of the recombination lifetime have resulted in the displacement current from the drain and gate capacitances to be the dominant component of the charge dump current.

Device design for subthreshold slope and threshold voltage control in sub-100 nm fully-depleted SOI MOSFETs###Device design issues regarding threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) control, short channel effects (SCE) and subthreshold slope are quantitatively studied for fully-depleted (FD) SOI MOSFETs under the sub-100 nm regime. As for the Vth adjustment method, the combination of back gate bias (V<sub>g2</sub>) and gate work function (&Phi;<sub>m</sub>) control is found to provide superior SCE, V<sub>th</sub> fluctuation due to SOI thickness variation and current drive. As for the subthreshold slope (SS), on the other hand, the optimization of thickness and permittivity of buried oxides is a key issue. It is found that, when the gate length is less than 100 nm, SS has a minimum value at buried oxide thickness of around 40 nm, irrespective of SOI thickness. It is also shown that the reduction in the permittivity of buried oxides improves SS.

Extremely scaled fully depleted SOI CMOS###There is new interest in FD/SOI CMOS because of its potential superior scalability relative to bulk-Si CMOS. Indeed, recent experimental device studies have implied that short-channel effects (SCEs) can be controlled in FD/SOI MOSFETs scaled to L<sub>gate</sub> < 50nm by thinning the SOI-film thickness (t<sub>Si</sub>). While series resistance in such scaled devices has been stressed as a significant issue, simultaneous threshold-voltage (V<sub>t</sub>) control in both CMOS devices, dependent on gate work functions as well as t<sub>Si</sub> and Si-channel doping density (N<sub>CH</sub>), on carrier-energy quantization in thin Si films, and on the SCEs, has not been addressed comprehensively. In this paper, we use numerical device simulations and process-based device circuit simulations to examine this issue, giving insights on FD/SOI CMOS scalability and performance.

A 1-V cyclic ADC using FD-SOI sample/hold circuits for sensor networks###Summary form only given. Recently, there has been much interest in sensor network systems that gather various analog signals, such as vital signs or environmental information, and that are connected to each other by a network In those systems, as there are huge number of sensing nodes, it is important that they are small and low power. To achieve this, the ADC, a key component in the node, should be small and operate at a supply voltage below 1 V. This would reduce power directly. Moreover, the ADC must be able to handle various signals, the frequencies of which range from several ten Hz to several kHz. We have developed a cyclic ADC using 0.2 &mu;m CMOS/SOI technology.

This paper demonstrates a non-thermal approach to achieve the same layer splitting and transferring effect: the use of a microwave hybrid instead of the use of heating in the implanted ion-assist layer transfer method for the fabrication of SOI materials. One of the interesting effects in the process with microwave energy is that certain physical and chemical properties of materials can be altered under microwave irradiation to create several desired effects not observed in conventional processes.

Surface morphology of thin Si layers in SOI structures studied by scaling analysis and Fourier transformation of AFM images###Oxidation is one of the technological ways to manage of the top silicon film thickness for modern VLSI creation. DeleCut wafers are a promissing candidate for ultra thin SOI creation. It is known that thermal oxide has abrupt compositional transition between Si and SiO<sub>2</sub> through one Si atomic layer. Another one is a structural transition layer which is a sum of two Si atomic layers 0.2 nm and &sim;0.8 nm on the SiO<sub>2</sub> side of the interface.

Novel SOI-like structures for improved thermal dissipation###An SOI-like structure with adequate buried insulator replacing the BOX is extremely attractive for improved thermal dissipation. The resulting material is still SOI-like: thin Si film, high-k dielectric, Si substrate, and can be synthesized by adapting the current bonding techniques. The argument in favor of high-k dielectrics is that they will be used as gate insulators anyway, and high-k technology is being optimized; the whole process is simplified by considering 'symmetrical' oxides. The approach is illustrated with a simple thermal mode, which is validated by self-consistent 2D numerical simulations.

Carrier recombination and thin gate oxide effects in floating body SOI MOSFETs: influence of the device geometries and architectures###To face the SIA roadmap constraints, the natural benefits of the SOI devices should be combined with aggressive scaling. The main ingredients for optimizing the SOI-MOSFETs architecture are film and gate oxide thickness, doping profiles (channel, halos and LDD regions) and lateral isolation techniques. In this paper, we show that the characteristics of floating body SOI devices are modified at low drain voltage by a gate to body current when the gate oxide thickness is as low as 2 nm. Carrier recombination and transconductance measurements versus gate voltage show that the modifications depend both on the geometries and device architecture (doping profiles).

Nominal supply voltage lowering down to 1.2 V (digital part) and 1.5 V (analog part) was achieved using a 0.25 &mu;m partially-depleted CMOS/SOI technology. Device level simulations were done with the LETISOI model. Measurements proved the chip functionality and the suitability of the technology for lower voltages. To our knowledge, it is the first mixed-mode CMOS/SOI chip dedicated to RFID.

Bipolar leakage modeling for switch-level simulators###Bipolar leakage is problematic; it can cause noise upset in dynamic circuits and can increase SRAM access time. Accurate (transient) simulation of charge loss due to bipolar leakage requires modeling the SOI-MOSFET as a network of diodes and capacitors, and then solving for the body voltage and bipolar leakage current. Such complexity is incompatible with the operation of approximate simulators (e.g., switch-level), which provide fairly accurate and very fast simulations relative to SPICE. A preliminary model for approximate simulators has been developed; it targeted the case of bipolar leakage triggered by full logic swing signals. In this paper, a more accurate bipolar leakage model which handles arbitrary signals, including noise pulses, is presented.

3D mode converters for SOI integrated optics###This paper reports on the development of a new mode converter technology for the growing SOI integrated optics field. Mode converters were designed and fabricated to permit efficient coupling of typical 10-&mu;m diameter optical fiber modes to single mode SOI waveguide structures as small as 0.25 &mu;m. A three-dimensional adiabatic taper approach was employed based on graytone lithography. This device is an important enabler for practical subwavelength SOI-waveguide integrated optics technology.
