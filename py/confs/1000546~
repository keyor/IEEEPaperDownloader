An empirical study of availability in friend-to-friend storage systems###Friend-to-friend networks, i.e. peer-to-peer networks where data are exchanged and stored solely through nodes owned by trusted users, can guarantee dependability, privacy and uncensorability by exploiting social trust. However, the limitation of storing data only on friends can come to the detriment of data availability: if no friends are online, then data stored in the system will not be accessible. In this work, we explore the tradeoffs between redundancy (i.e., how many copies of data are stored on friends), data placement (the choice of which friend nodes to store data on) and data availability (the probability of finding data online). We show that the problem of obtaining maximal availability while minimizing redundancy is NP-complete; in addition, we perform an exploratory study on data placement strategies, and we investigate their performance in terms of redundancy needed and availability obtained. By performing a trace-based evaluation, we show that nodes with as few as 10 friends can already obtain good availability levels.

Byzantine fault tolerance of regenerating codes###Recent years have witnessed a slew of coding techniques custom designed for networked storage systems. Network coding inspired regenerating codes are the most prolifically studied among these new age storage centric codes. A lot of effort has been invested in understanding the fundamental achievable trade-offs of storage and bandwidth usage to maintain redundancy in presence of different models of failures, showcasing the efficacy of regenerating codes with respect to traditional erasure coding techniques. For practical usability in open and adversarial environments, as is typical in peer-to-peer systems, we need however not only resilience against erasures, but also from (adversarial) errors. In this paper, we study the resilience of generalized regenerating codes (supporting multi-repairs, using collaboration among newcomers) in the presence of two classes of Byzantine nodes, relatively benign selfish (non-cooperating) nodes, as well as under more active, malicious polluting nodes. We give upper bounds on the resilience capacity of regenerating codes, and show that the advantages of collaborative repair can turn to be detrimental in the presence of Byzantine nodes. We further exhibit that system mechanisms can be combined with regenerating codes to mitigate the effect of rogue nodes.

Enforcing fairness in P2P storage systems using asymmetric reciprocal exchanges###In P2P storage systems peers need to contribute some local storage resources in order to obtain a certain online and reliable storage capacity. To guarantee that the storage service works, P2P storage systems have to meet two main requirements. First, the storage system needs to maintain fairness among peers by ensuring that peers consuming more online storage capacity contribute more local storage resources. And second, to reduce redundancy costs and improve reliability, the storage system must incentivize low-available peers to improve their online availability. Traditionally, P2P storage systems achieved these two requirements by (i) using symmetric reciprocal exchanges between peers, and by (ii) allowing peers to selfishly select their set of storage partners. However, in this paper we show that these two mechanisms are suboptimal in terms of the overall storage resources contributed by all peers. To minimize this amount of contributed resources, we design a novel incentive mechanism based on asymmetric reciprocal exchanges between peers. Our mechanism incentivizes peers to select storage partners uniformly at random, and to establish asymmetric exchange relationships with them. These asymmetric exchange relationships allow low-available peers to compensate the increase of redundancy of high-available peers by giving them more storage capacity. We show that our solution reduces the overall amount of contributed resources as well as the resources contributed by each peer individually. Using real P2P availability traces, we show that our incentive mechanism can reduce the overall savings up to 60%, and individual savings from 2% up to 75%, depending on peers' availabilities.

Inferring peer centrality in socially-informed peer-to-peer systems###Social applications implemented on a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture mine the social graph of their users for improved performance in search, recommendations, resource sharing and others. In such applications, the social graph that connects their users is distributed on the peer-to-peer system: the traversal of the social graph translates to a socially-informed routing in the peer-to-peer layer. In this work we introduce the model of a projection graph that is the result of mapping a social graph onto a peer-to-peer network. We analytically formulate the relation between metrics in the social graph and in the projection graph. We focus on three such graph metrics: degree centrality, node betweenness centrality, and edge betweenness centrality. We evaluate experimentally the feasibility of estimating these metrics in the projection graph from the metrics of the social graph. Our experiments on real networks show that when mapping communities of 50-150 users on a peer, there is an optimal organization of the projection graph with respect to degree and node betweenness centrality. In this range, the association between the properties of the social graph and the projection graph is the highest, and thus the properties of the (dynamic) projection graph can be inferred from the properties of the (slower changing) social graph. We discuss the applicability of our findings to aspects of peer-to-peer systems such as data dissemination, social search, peer vulnerability, and data placement and caching.

Here is your peer! &#x2014; Locating peers on a regional level with network coordinates###It seems to be common wisdom that peer-to-peer overlay networks should reflect the structure of the underlying network to minimize the application-level latency, to increase the throughput, and to optimize the traffic for the Internet service providers. Network coordinates are one means to achieve this goal. However, previous real-world experiments were disappointing because methods like Vivaldi could not resolve the structure of the underlying network better than at a continental level. In our work, we have closely analyzed the reasons for that disappointing performance. Thereby, we were able to improve Vivaldi-like network coordinate systems so that they can now differentiate peers at a regional level. In this paper, we report on a large measurement study that we performed with the Vuze BitTorrent client. We show that these improved algorithms can indeed differentiate among different autonomous systems and different geographic regions. We also show that this achievement is less important than commonly thought and that the key contribution lies rather in the latency-optimal overlay formation itself.

Autonomous detection of connectivity###This paper contributes a protocol that measures underlay connectivity properties of nodes in an overlay network. The protocol autonomously assigns a unique random identifier to each subset of nodes that can communicate transitively using arbitrary underlay routing protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, RFCOMM), denoted connectivity domain. We denote nodes in more than one connectivity domains relays, as they can forward messages between connectivity domains. This information is useful for overlay construction, as possible overlay neighbors must be in the same connectivity domain while relays enable communication between nodes in different connectivity domains. The general problem of identifying maximal connectivity domains is equivalent to the problem of finding all maximal cliques. We show that it can be efficiently approximated in an overlay setting with only partial knowledge of the network connectivity graph. The key observation is that in such scenario once all we discovered all relays remaining nodes can agree on a unique identifier per connectivity domain. We show by theoretical analysis and extensive simulations that the approach is accurate, scalable, resilient, and reactive to connectivity changes in the underlay network.

Network aware P2P multimedia streaming: Capacity or locality?###P2P content providers are motivated to localize traffic within Autonomous Systems and therefore alleviate the tension with ISPs stemming from costly inter-AS traffic generated by geographically distributed P2P users. In this paper, we first present a new three-tier framework to conduct a thorough study on the impact of various capacity aware or locality aware neighbor selection and chunk scheduling strategies. Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid neighbor selection strategy with the flexibility to elect neighbors based on either type of network awareness with different probabilities. We find that network awareness in terms of both capacity and locality potentially degrades system QoS as a whole and that capacity awareness faces effort-based unfairness, but enables contribution-based fairness. Extensive simulations show that hybrid neighbor selection can not only promote traffic locality but lift streaming quality and that the crux of traffic locality promotion is active overlay construction. Based on this observation, we then propose a totally decentralized network awareness protocol, equipped with hybrid neighbor selection. In realistic simulation environments, this protocol can reduce inter-AS traffic from 95% to 38% - a locality performance comparable with tracker-side strategies (35%) under the premise of high streaming quality. Our performance evaluation results provide valuable insights for both theoretical study on selfish topologies and real-deployed system design.

Adaptive load balancing in KAD###The endeavor of this work is to study the impact of content popularity in a large-scale Peer-to-Peer network, namely KAD. Armed with the insights gained from an extensive measurement campaign, which pinpoints several deficiencies of the present KAD design in handling popular objects, we set off to design and evaluate an adaptive load balancing mechanism. Our mechanism is backward compatible with KAD, as it only modifies its inner algorithms, and presents several desirable properties: (i) it drives the process that selects the number and location of peers responsible to store references to objects, based on their popularity; (ii) it solves problems related to saturated peers, that entail a significant drop in the diversity of references to objects, and (iii) if coupled with an enhanced content search procedure, it allows a more fair and efficient usage of peer resources, at a reasonable cost. Our evaluation uses a trace-driven simulator that features realistic peer churn and a precise implementation of the inner components of KAD.

Towards optimal keyword-based content dissemination in DHT-based P2P networks###Keyword-based content alert services, e.g., Google Alerts and Microsoft Live Alerts, empower the end users with the ability to automatically receive useful and most recent content. In this paper, we leverage the favorable properties of DHTs, such as scalability, and propose a design of a scalable keyword-based content alert service. The DHT-based architecture matches textual documents with queries based on document terms: For each term, the implementation assigns a home node that is responsible for handling documents and queries that contain the term. The main challenge of this keyword-based matching scheme is the high number of terms that appear in a typical document resulting in a high publication cost. Fortunately, a document can be forwarded to the home nodes of a carefully selected subset of terms without incurring false negatives. In this paper we focus on the MTAF problem of minimizing the number of selected terms to forward the published content. We show that the problem is NP-hardness, and consider centralized and DHT-based solutions. Experimental results based on real datasets indicate that the proposed solutions are efficient compared to existing approaches. In particular, the similarity-based replication of filters that is a key element of our solution is shown to mitigate the effect of hotspots that arise due to the fact that some document terms are substantially more popular than the others, both inside documents and queries.

Flexible routing tables: Designing routing algorithms for overlays based on a total order on a routing table set###This paper presents Flexible Routing Tables (FRT), a method for designing routing algorithms for overlay networks. FRT facilitates extending routing algorithms to reflect factors other than node identifiers. An FRT-based algorithm defines a total order on the set of all patterns of a routing table, and performs identifier-based routing according to that order. The algorithm gradually refines its routing table along the order by three operations: guarantee of reachability, entry learning, and entry filtering. This paper presents FRT-Chord, an FRT-based distributed hash table, and gives proof that it achieves O(log N)-hop lookups. Experiments with its implementation show that the routing table refining process proceeds as designed. Grouped FRT (GFRT), which introduces node groups into FRT, is also presented to demonstrate FRT's flexibility. GFRT-Chord resulted in a smaller numbers of routing hops between node groups than both Chord and FRT-Chord.

Sub-second lookups on a large-scale Kademlia-based overlay###Previous studies of large-scale (multimillion node) Kademlia-based DHTs have shown poor performance, measured in seconds; in contrast to the far more optimistic results from theoretical analysis, simulations and testbeds. In this paper, we unexpectedly find that in the Mainline BitTorrent DHT (MDHT), probably the largest DHT overlay on the Internet, many lookups already yield results in less than a second, albeit not consistently. With our backwards-compatible modifications, we show that not only can we reduce median latencies to between 100 and 200 ms, but also consistently achieve sub-second lookups. These results suggest that it is possible to deploy latency-sensitive applications on top of large-scale DHT overlays on the Internet, contrary to what some might have concluded based on previous results reported in the literature.

Cloudy weather for P2P, with a chance of gossip###Peer-to-peer (P2P) and cloud computing, two of the Internet trends of the last decade, hold similar promises: the (virtually) infinite availability of computing and storage resources. But there are important differences: the cloud provides highly-available resources, but at a cost; P2P resources are for free, but their availability is shaky. Several academic and commercial projects have explored the possibility of mixing the two, creating a large number of peer-assisted applications, particularly in the field of content distribution, where the cloud provides a highly-available and persistent service, while P2P resources are exploited for free whenever possible to reduce the economic cost. While executing active servers on elastic computing facilities like Amazon EC2 and pairing them with user-provided peers is definitely one way to go, this paper proposes a novel approach that further reduces the economic cost. Here, a passive storage service like Amazon S3 is exploited not only to distribute content to clients, but also to build and manage the P2P network linking them. An effort is made to guarantee that the read/write load imposed on the storage remains constant, regardless of the number of peers/clients. These two choices allows us to keep the monetary cost of the cloud always under control, in the presence of just one peer or with a million of them. We show the feasibility of our approach by discussing two cases studies for content distribution: the Dilbert's comic strips and the hourly News Update podcast from CNN.

Unrevealing the structure of live BitTorrent swarms: Methodology and analysis###BitTorrent is one of the most popular application in the current Internet. However, we still have little knowledge about the topology of real BitTorrent swarms and how the traffic is actually exchanged among peers. This paper addresses fundamental questions regarding the topology of live BitTorrent swarms. For this purpose we have collected the evolution of the graph topology of 250 real torrents from its birth during a period of 15 days. Using this dataset we first demonstrate that real BitTorrent swarms are neither random graphs nor small world networks. Furthermore, we will see how some factors such as the torrent popularity affect the swarm topology. Secondly, the paper proposes a novel methodology in order to infer the clustered peers in real BitTorrent swarms, something that was not possible so far. Finally, we dedicate special effort to demonstrate that current BitTorrent swarms are experiencing a marked locality phenomenon at the overlay construction level (or connectivity graph). This locality effect is even more pronounced when we consider the exchange traffic relationships between peers. This suggests that an important portion of the BitTorrent traffic is currently confined within the ISPs. This opens a discussion regarding the relative gain of the locality solution proposed so far.

Measuring BitTorrent swarms beyond reach###BitTorrent is one of the most popular P2P file sharing applications in the world. Each BitTorrent network is called a swarm and millions of peers may join multiple swarms. However, there are many unreachable peers (NATed, Fire-Walled, or inactive at the time of the measurement) in each swarm. Due to this unreachable peers problem, the existing work can measure only a part of the entire peers in a swarm. In this paper, we propose an improved measurement method for BitTorrent swarms that many unreachable peers. In a nutshell, our crawler obtains peers behind NAT and firewalls by letting them connect to our crawlers through actively advertising our crawlers addresses to them. The evaluation result shows that our proposed method increases the number of unique contacted peers by 112 % compared to the conventional method. The proposed method also increases the total volume of downloaded pieces by 66 %. We then investigate the sampling bias among our proposed method and conventional methods, and find that different measurement methods can lead to significantly different measurement results.

Tribler: Search and stream###Tribler is an open-source software project facilitating searching, streaming and sharing content using P2P technology that has been used by over 800 000 people. The Tribler P2P core supports BitTorrent-compatible downloading, video on demand and live streaming. We continuously work on extensions and test out novel research ideas within our user base, resulting in sub-second content search, a reputation system for rewarding upload, and channels for content publishing and spam prevention.

In-network P2P packet cache processing using scalable P2P network test platform###The continuous growth of P2P traffic imposes a large burden on ISP network operation. To reduce P2P traffic, the redundancy elimination using P2P packet cache scheme is effective since P2P swarm contains the high redundancy. We have developed the P2P shared packet cache architecture. We have validated the basic operations of the proposed architecture on Emulab [1], [2]. In this demo, we present the test platform desirable to perform the in-network P2P cache processing together with the scalable generation of the user clients. The test network can be created on the programmable virtualized slice network by VNode which has been developed for the future network study [3]. To enable the emulation of the scalable user access, VM clustered overlay network is integrated with the slice network. Using the virtualized test network platform, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the P2P cache processing.

Persistent naming for P2P Web hosting###The peer-to-peer paradigm has great potential of contributing to the next generation web-hosting infrastructure. Profound advancements in P2P technologies in the last decade have proven their capability to provide the same functionality as traditional client-server systems at a much larger scale and much lower cost. Existing centralized website hosting technology has a number of inherent deficiencies, including: scalability issues; single point of failure; administrative overhead; and hosting expenses. P2P Web hosting can effectively address these problems and open a new era for the next generation web technology. Unlike the current web however, peer availability and content placement are highly dynamic in P2P networks. This dynamism raises a number of research challenges related to naming, indexing, searching and hosting in P2P environments. In this paper we identify the practical requirements for devising a persistent naming scheme for P2P web-hosting on top of highly dynamic non-persistent P2P networks and present a novel naming architecture for satisfying these requirements.

Nemor: A congestion-aware protocol for anonymous peer-based content distribution###As content providers adopt peer-to-peer approaches for content sharing and distribution, they face new challenges in guaranteeing privacy to their clients. Participating peers can glean information from their communication with other peers, such as their identities or the shared data and use this information for malicious purposes. We present Nemor, a protocol that allows a requesting peer and a corresponding serving peer to communicate anonymously with each other and from other participating peers, while protecting the identity of the content being exchanged. Nemor relies on a trusted intermediary, such as a provider-managed tracker, to identify a potential serving peer. A peer in Nemor joins one or more trees. Using a combination of a random walk, a probabilistic jump from one tree to another and constrained flooding, the requesting and serving peer dynamically construct an overlay path between them. A key differentiator of Nemor is the integrated design of a congestion avoidance mechanism that yields significant performance benefits without compromising on anonymity. Using experimental results from PlanetLab and simulations with traces from an operational VoD system, we demonstrate that Nemor outperforms state of the art approaches like TOR and OneSwarm. Our results confirm that Nemor, while being resilient to attacks on anonymity, achieves high performance and scalability and is suitable for a range of applications, including distribution of large volume content, such as streaming video.

Efficient and highly available peer discovery: A case for independent trackers and gossiping###Tracker-based peer-discovery is used in most commercial peer-to-peer content distribution systems, as it provides performance benefits compared to distributed solutions, and facilitates the control and monitoring of the overlay. But a tracker is a central point of failure, and its deployment and maintenance incur costs; hence an important question is how high tracker availability can be achieved at low cost. We investigate highly available, low overhead peer discovery, using independent trackers and a simple gossip protocol. This work is a step towards understanding the trade-off between the overhead and the achievable peer connectivity in highly available distributed overlay-management systems for peer-to-peer content distribution. We propose two protocols that connect peers in different swarms efficiently with a constant, but tunable, overhead. The two protocols, Random Peer Migration (RPM) and Random Multi-Tracking (RMT), employ a small fraction of peers in a torrent to virtually increase the size of swarms. We develop analytical models of the protocols based on renewal theory, and validate the models using both extensive simulations and controlled experiments. We illustrate the potential value of the protocols using large-scale measurement data that contains hundreds of thousands of public torrents with several small swarms, with limited peer connectivity. We estimate the achievable gains to be up to 40% on average for small torrents.

Fast download but eternal seeding: The reward and punishment of Sharing Ratio Enforcement###Many private BitTorrent communities employ Sharing Ratio Enforcement (SRE) schemes to incentivize users to contribute their upload resources. It has been demonstrated that communities that use SRE are greatly oversupplied, i.e., they have much higher seeder-to-leecher ratios than communities in which SRE is not employed. The first order effect of oversupply under SRE is a positive increase in the average downloading speed. However, users are forced to seed for extremely long times to maintain adequate sharing ratios to be able to start new downloads. In this paper, we propose a fluid model to study the effects of oversupply under SRE, which predicts the average downloading speed, the average seeding time, and the average upload capacity utilization for users in communities that employ SRE. We notice that the phenomenon of oversupply has two undesired negative effects: a) Peers are forced to seed for long times, even though their seeding efforts are often not very productive (in terms of low upload capacity utilization); and b) SRE discriminates against peers with low bandwidth capacities and forces them to seed for longer durations than peers with high capacities. To alleviate these problems, we propose four different strategies for SRE, which have been inspired by ideas in social sciences and economics. We evaluate these strategies through simulations. Our results indicate that these new strategies release users from needlessly long seeding durations, while also being fair towards peers with low capacities and maintaining high system-wide downloading speeds.

B-Tracker: Improving load balancing and efficiency in distributed P2P trackers###Trackers are used in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks for provider discovery, that is, mapping resources to potential providers. Centralized trackers, e.g., as in the original BitTorrent protocol, do not benefit from P2P properties, such as no single point of failure, scalability, and load balancing. Decentralized mechanisms have thus been proposed, based on distributed hash tables (DHTs) and gossiping, such as BitTorrent's Peer Exchange (PEX). While DHT-based trackers suffer from load balancing problems, gossip-based ones cannot deliver new mappings quickly. This paper presents B-Tracker, a fully-distributed, pull-based tracker. B-Tracker extends DHT functionality by distributing the tracker load among all providers in a swarm. Bloom filters are used to avoid redundant mappings to be transmitted. This results in the important properties of load balancing and scalability, while adding the ability for peers to fetch new mappings instantly. B-Tracker shows, through simulations, improved load balancing and better efficiency when compared to pure DHTs and PEX.

Inter-swarm resource allocation in BitTorrent communities###A considerable body of research shows that Bit-Torrent provides very efficient resource allocation inside single swarms. Many BitTorrent clients also allow users to participate in multiple swarms simultaneously, and implement inter-swarm resource-allocation mechanisms that are used by millions of people. However, resource allocation across multiple swarms in BitTorrent has received much less attention. In this paper, we investigate whether currently prevalent inter-swarm resource allocation mechanisms perform acceptably or call for improvements. We use data from two BitTorrent communities and present results from trace-based simulations. Two use-cases for allocation mechanisms drive our evaluation: (1) file-sharing communities, whose objective is maximizing throughput, and (2) video-streaming communities, whose objective is maximizing the number of users receiving sufficient resources for uninterrupted streaming. To put the results from the analyzed mechanisms into perspective, we devise theoretical efficiency bounds for inter-swarm resource allocation, for which we map the resource allocation problem to a graph-theoretical flow network problem. In this formalism, the goal of the file-sharing use-case, throughput maximization, is equivalent to maximizing the flow in the network. The goal of the video-streaming use-case translates into finding a max-min fair allocation for BitTorrent downloading sessions, a problem for which we devise a new algorithm.

PPVA: A universal and transparent P2SP accelerator for online video sharing###To alleviate the server bandwidth cost of online video sharing services, p2p delivering has been suggested as an effective tool with success already seen in accelerating individual sites. The numerous video sharing sites existed however call for a universal solution that provides transparent p2p acceleration beyond ad hoc solutions. More importantly, only a universal platform can fully explore the aggregated video and client resources across sites, particular for identical videos replicated in diverse sites. To this end, we develop PPVA, a working platform for universal and transparent P2SP (peer to server and peer) accelerating. As of May 2011, it has attracted over 190 million distinct clients, with 78 million daily transactions. We will demonstrate the novel features, implementation, and also effectiveness of PPVA.

MONAC: SNS message dissemination over smartphone-based DTN and cloud###In this work, we implemented a messaging system called MONAC, by which users can disseminate Twitter messages via smartphone-based DTN. MONAC is implemented on an overlay network middleware called PIAX. We extended PIAX to enable DTN with dynamic selection of available underlay network and seamless authentication for SNS account of cloud. By these mechanisms, messages can be disseminated via DTN on heterogeneous underlay networks without falsification and user ID frauds.

Identifying, analyzing, and modeling flashcrowds in BitTorrent###Flashcrowds - sudden surges of user arrivals - do occur in BitTorrent, and they can lead to severe service deprivation. However, very little is known about their occurrence patterns and their characteristics in real-world deployments, and many basic questions about BitTorrent flashcrowds, such as How often do they occur? and How long do they last?, remain unanswered. In this paper, we address these questions by studying three datasets that cover millions of swarms from two of the largest BitTorrent trackers. We first propose a model for BitTorrent flashcrowds and a procedure for identifying, analyzing, and modeling BitTorrent flashcrowds. Then we evaluate quantitatively the impact of flashcrowds on BitTorrent users, and we develop an algorithm that identifies BitTorrent flashcrowds. Finally, we study statistically the properties of BitTorrent flashcrowds identified from our datasets, such as their arrival time, duration, and magnitude, and we investigate the relationship between flashcrowds and swarm growth, and the arrival rate of flashcrowds in BitTorrent trackers. In particular, we find that BitTorrent flashcrowds only occur in very small fractions (0.3-2%) of the swarms but that they can affect over ten million users.

Exploring peer heterogeneity: Towards understanding and application###The heterogeneous nature of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks can be exploited to optimize a wide range of applications. But this requires an accurate characterization of peer heterogeneity, which is difficult due to huge population and disparate properties of individuals. To overcome this barrier, we conduct a thorough inspection of peer heterogeneity in terms of individual churn and resource capacity. We make a first attempt to (i) experimentally reduce heterogeneous churn and resource dynamics to simple distributions with individual-specific parameters, and to (ii) provide an empirical support for the heterogeneous Markov model of churn. We further demonstrate how our characterization can be leveraged to optimize practical systems, through two case studies: fast backup in online storage and fault-tolerance in cycle-sharing systems. Both applications gain remarkable performance improvement by incorporating our model of peer heterogeneity.

Efficient bandwidth estimation for peer-to-peer systems###Many peer-to-peer (P2P) systems require accurate information about their peer's available bandwidth, e.g., for load balancing. Determining this information is difficult, as a suitable approach must address two challenges. First, it must be able to deal with fluctuating bandwidth. Second, it must incur low overhead to prevent interference with the operation of the P2P system. In this paper we present an approach to estimate the available bandwidth of peers in a P2P system, based on a combination of traffic observation and the strategic injection of traffic into the system. We evaluate our approach and show that it is accurate and responsive in settings with variable bandwidth while resulting in limited interference with the system.

Passive characterization of sopcast usage in residential ISPs###In this paper we present an extensive analysis of traffic generated by SopCast users and collected from operative networks of three national ISPs in Europe. After more than a year of continuous monitoring, we present results about the popularity of SopCast which is the largely preferred application in the studied networks. We focus on analysis of (i) application and bandwidth usage at different time scales, (ii) peer lifetime, arrival and departure processes, (iii) peer localization in the world. Results provide useful insights into users' behavior, including their attitude towards P2P-TV application usage and the consequent generated load on the network, that is quite variable based on the access technology and geographical location. Our findings are interesting to Researchers interested in the investigation of users' attitude towards P2P-TV services, to foresee new trends in the future usage of the Internet, and to augment the design of their application.

Cooperative session control over core and overlay networks for a new generation network###This paper proposes a cooperative session control method over core and overlay networks for a new generation network (NWGN). In the method, the call setup time is guaranteed via cooperating core and overlay networks while minimizing processing and traffic loads on the core network. During session control, each peer selects either the core or overlay network to establish the session based on the measured latency on the overlay network. Proprietary technology (the so-called Blacklist method) was used for latency estimation on the overlay network. In addition, this paper explains a developed test-bed system and discusses the evaluation results.

Towards a comparative performance evaluation of overlays for Networked Virtual Environments###Peer-to-peer overlays for Networked Virtual Environments have recently gained much research interest, resulting in a variety of different approaches for spatial information dissemination. Although designed for the same purpose, the evaluation methodologies used by particular authors differ widely. This makes any comparison of existing systems difficult, if not impossible. To overcome this problem we present a benchmarking methodology which allows for a fair comparison of those systems. We, therefore, define a common set of workloads and metrics. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by testing four typical systems for spatial information dissemination and discovering their specific performance profiles.

Content pollution quantification in large P2P networks : A measurement study on KAD###Content pollution is one of the major issues affecting P2P file sharing networks. However, since early studies on FastTrack and Overnet, no recent investigation has reported its impact on current P2P networks. In this paper, we present a method and the supporting architecture to quantify the pollution of contents in the KAD network. We first collect information on many popular files shared in this network. Then, we propose a new way to detect content pollution by analyzing all filenames linked to a content with a metric based on the Tversky index and which gives very low error rates. By analyzing a large number of popular files, we show that 2/3 of the contents are polluted, one part by index poisoning but the majority by a new, more dangerous, form of pollution that we call index falsification.

Efficient peer-to-peer backup services through buffering at the edge###The availability of end devices of peer-to-peer storage and backup systems has been shown critical for usability and for system reliability in practice. This has led to the adoption of hybrid architectures composed of both peers and servers. Such architectures mask the instability of peers thus approaching the performances of client-server systems while providing scalability at a low cost. In this paper, we advocate the replacement of such servers by a cloud of residential gateways, as they are already present in users' homes, thus pushing the required stable components at the edge of the network. In our gateway-assisted system, gateways act as buffers between peers, compensating for their intrinsic instability. This enables to offload backup tasks quickly from the user's machine to the gateway, while significantly lowering the retrieval time of backed up data. We evaluate our proposal using real world traces including existing traces from Skype and Jabber as well as a trace of residential gateways for availability, and a residential broadband trace for bandwidth. Results show that the time required to backup data in the network is comparable to a server-assisted approach, while substantially improving the time to restore data, which drops from a few days to a few hours. As gateways are becoming increasingly powerful in order to enable new services, we expect such a proposal to be leveraged on a short term basis.

Data transfer scheduling for P2P storage###In Peer-to-Peer storage and backup applications, large amounts of data have to be transferred between nodes. In general, recipient of data transfers are not chosen randomly from the whole set of nodes in the Peer-to-Peer networks, but they are chosen according to peer selection rules imposing several criteria, such as resource contributions, position in DHTs, or trust between nodes. Imposing too stringent restrictions on the choice of nodes that are eligible to receive data can have a negative impact on the amount of time needed to complete data transfer, and scheduling choices influence this result as well. We formalize the problem of data transfer scheduling, and devise means for calculating (knowing a posteriori the availability patterns of nodes) optimal scheduling choices; we then propose and evaluate realistic scheduling policies, and evaluate their overheads in transfer times with respect to the optimal. We show that allowing even a small flexibility in choosing nodes after the peer selection step results in large improvements on time to complete transfers, and that even simple informed scheduling policies can significantly reduce transfer time overhead.

PeerfactSim.KOM: A P2P system simulator &#x2014; Experiences and lessons learned###Research on peer-to-peer (p2p) and distributed systems needs evaluation tools to predict and observe the behavior of protocols and mechanisms in large scale networks. PeerfactSim.KOM [1] is a simulator for large scale distributed/p2p systems aiming at the evaluation of interdependencies in multi-layered p2p systems. The simulator is written in Java, is event-based and mainly used in p2p research projects. The main development of PeerfactSim.KOM started in 2005 and is driven since 2006 by the project "QuaP2P", which aims at the systematic improvement and benchmarking of p2p systems. Further users of the simulator are working in the project "On-the-fly Computing" aiming at researching p2p-based service oriented architectures. Both projects state severe requirements on the evaluation of multi-layered and large-scale distributed systems. We describe the architecture of PeerfactSim.KOM supporting these requirements in Section II, present the workflow, selected experiences and lessons learned in Section III and conclude the overview in Section IV.

In order to orchestrate Spades platform, we have designed and implemented Sbam middleware.

Pitfalls of re-sharing BitTorrent contents: The failure of daily pattern###Peer-to-peer file sharing systems, most notably Bit-Torrent (BT), have achieved tremendous success among Internet users. Recent studies suggest that the long-term relationships among BT peers can be explored to enhance the downloading performance; for example, the cooperation of peers to re-share old contents. However, whether such relationships can be built still remain unknown. In this paper, we take a first step towards the real-world applicability of the content re-sharing through a measurement based study. We find that 95% peers cannot even meet each other again in the BT networks; therefore, most peers can hardly be organized for further cooperation. This result is contradict to the conventional understanding based on the observed daily arrival pattern in peer-to-peer networks. To better understand this, we revisit the arrival of BT peers as well as their long-range dependence. We find that the peers' arrival patterns are highly diverse; only a limited number of peers have very clear self-similar and periodic daily arrival features (which we call them "stable peers"). The arrivals of other peers are, however, quite random with the clear absence of long-range dependence.

SocialHelpers: Introducing social trust to ameliorate churn in P2P reputation systems###Reputation systems rely on historical information to account for uncertainty about the intention of users to cooperate. In peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, however, accumulating experience tends to be slow due to the high rates of churn - the continuous process of arrival and departure of peers. The flow of transactions is continuously interrupted by departures, which can significantly affect the convergence of reputation systems. To shed light on this, this paper presents an accurate model for capturing the influence of churn on the process of building reputations. Using our model, system architects can determine the minimal transaction rate that guarantees fast convergence and design their systems accordingly. Unfortunately, the natural transaction rate of users is sometimes too low (e.g., due to physical constraints like network bandwidth, etc.) that many of them are likely to experience significant delays in the process of building reputations for their neighbors. We face this problem by leveraging the inherent trust in social networks. The basic idea is that users ask their social links to transact with strangers and together generate reputation ratings in a short time scale. Our simulation results report reductions of 50% or greater in the convergence time in environments with high churn rates.

Efficient dissemination in decentralized social networks###Online social networks (OSN) have attracted millions of users worldwide. This enormous success is not without problems; the centralized architectures of OSNs, storing the users' personal data, provides ample opportunity for privacy violation - a fact that has raised the demand for open, decentralized alternatives. We tackle the research question: is it possible to build a decentralized OSN over a social overlay, i.e., an overlay network whose links among nodes mirror the social network relationships among the nodes' owners? This paper provides a stepping stone to the answer, by focusing on the key OSN functionality of disseminating profile updates. Our approach relies on gossip protocols. We show that mainstream gossip protocols are inefficient, due to the properties that characterize social networks. We then leverage these very same properties towards our goal, by appropriately modifying gossip forwarding rules. Our evaluation, performed in simulation over a crawled real-world social network, shows that our protocols provide acceptable latency, foster load balancing across nodes, and tolerate churn.

PcubeCast: A novel peer-assisted live streaming system###In this paper, we propose a P2P-based live streaming system called PcubeCast. Different from conventional P2P systems, PcubeCast utilizes servers to ensure end-user QoS. Thus, the proposed PcubeCast takes advantage of traditional systems: 1) Quality-of-Service(QoS) from client-server systems and 2) scalability and cost reduction from P2P systems. Through the experiments with real-world application data, we show that PcubeCast improves scalability up to 10 times while ensuring end-user QoS.

P2P live streams of 2010 NHK National School Chorus Contest###This paper reports on the peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming service of the regional rounds of NHK National School Chorus Contest, which was held in August and September in 2010. To comply with many requirements from families of contestants in regional rounds, NHK started broadcasting regional contests live through the Internet using proprietary P2P broadcasting systems. The live streams attracted a total of 58,512 viewers nationwide during their entire schedules.

On the impact of uTP on BitTorrent completion time###BitTorrent, one of the most widespread file sharing P2P applications, recently introduced uTP, an application-level congestion control protocol which aims to efficiently use the available link capacity, while avoiding to interfere with the rest of user traffic (e.g., Web, VoIP and gaming) sharing the same access bottleneck. Research on uTP has so far focused on the investigation of the congestion control behavior on rather simple settings (i.e., single bottleneck, few backlogged flows, etc.), that are fairly far from the P2P settings in which the protocol is deployed. Moreover, prior work typically addressed questions, such as fairness and efficiency, that are natural from a congestion control context perspective, but are not directly related with the performance of the overall P2P system. In this work, we refine the understanding of uTP, by gauging its impact on the primary BitTorrent user-centric metric, namely the torrent download time, by means of packet level simulation. Results of our initial investigations show that: (i) in case uTP clients fully substitute TCP clients, no performance difference arise; (ii) in case of heterogeneous swarms, comprising peers using uTP and TCP congestion control, completion time of uTP peers can possibly benefit of lower uplink queuing delays, as signaling traffic (e.g., chunk requests) are not slowed down by long waits in the ADSL buffers.

My3: A highly-available P2P-based online social network###As the online social networks (OSNs), such as Facebook, witness explosive growth, the privacy challenges gain critical consideration from governmental and law agencies due to concentration of vast amount of personal information within a single administrative domain. In this paper, we demonstrate a privacy-aware decentralized OSN called My3, where users can exercise full access control on their data. Our system exploits trust relationships in the social network for providing the necessary decentralized storage infrastructure. By taking users' geographical locations and online time statistics into account, it also addresses availability and storage performance issues.

A 3D visualization system for structured overlays###Many structured overlays forward messages based not only on node identifiers but also on the other factors such as network proximity. It is an essential requirement for a visualization system to exhibit how the factors are considered in a overlay. Such a visualization system allows us to grasp intuitively characteristics of an overlay algorithm. If this is achieved, differences between algorithms become more distinguishable, and those who are unfamiliar with an algorithm are also able to know improvement between algorithms. Thus, such a visualization increases their interests in research activity in peer-to-peer computing. In this demonstration we propose a novel 3D visualization system for structured overlays. The system is practically able to visualize how routing algorithms consider node groups in an effective manner. We demonstrate the system with Chord and GFRT-Chord algorithms, but the system is able to visualize algorithms not limited to them.

An optimal topology for a static P2P live streaming network: Analysis and real-world results###In this paper we present a P2P live streaming topology which performs near the optimum under common constraints. We assume two types of nodes: viewers that consume the entire media, and amplifiers which are non-viewing nodes utilized for their upstream bandwidth. We analytically derive the minimum needed server upload, for any topology, under the constraint of limited total peer upload. Under this constraint, we prove that a 2-level topology for the amplifiers is optimal. Then, by running experiments on RayV's real-world commercial system, we demonstrate that in such a 2-level system the server upload is indeed near the minimum.

Live seeding: Performance bounds of seeders for P2P live streaming###Seeders (peers that do not request anything hut contribute to the system) allow to leverage the capacities of a P2P system. While seeding is a natural idea for fllesharing or Video-on-Demand applications, it seems somehow counter-intuitive in the context of live streaming. This paper aims at describing the feasibility and performance of P2P live seeding. After a formal definition of "live seeding" and efficiency, we consider the theoretical performance of systems where the overhead is neglected. We then propose a realistic overhead model and extend the results for this model. The performance of a single seeder and a set of seeders are considered, as it is not always possible to perfectly aggregate individual efficiencies. In details, we provide an explicit upper bound of seeders' achievable efficiency in a P2P system with linear overhead. We also propose and study two simple mechanisms that allow to deploy a live seeding architecture while handling seeders aggregation, providing near-optimal seeding.

Efficient stereo segment scheduling in peer-to-peer 3D/multi-view video streaming###3D (or stereo) video has been a visually appealing and costly affordable technology. More sophisticated multi-view videos have also been demonstrated. Yet their remarkably increased data volume poses greater challenges to the conventional client/server streaming systems, which has already suffered from supporting 2D videos. The stringent multi-stream synchronization further complicate the system design. In this paper, we present an initial attempt toward efficient streaming of stereo/multi-view videos over a peer-to-peer network. We show that the inherent multi-stream nature of stereo video makes segment scheduling more difficult, which is particularly acute with the existence of multiple senders in a peer-to-peer overlay. We formulate the stereo segment scheduling problem as a Binary Quadratic Programming problem and optimally solve it using an MIQP solver. However, given the high peer dynamics and the stringent playback deadline in real-time streaming, the optimal solution is too costly to be obtained. Thus, we develop two efficient algorithms to allow peers frequently compute the scheduling. We show that one of the proposed algorithms can achieve an analytical guarantee in the worst case performance, in particular, the approximation factor is at most 3 comparing with the optimal solution. We implement the proposed algorithms and the optimal in a peer-to-peer simulating system, and show that the proposed algorithms can achieve near-optimal performance efficiently. We further implement two other scheduling algorithms that are used in popular peer-to-peer streaming systems for comparison, and extend our design to support multi-view video with view diversity and dynamics. Under different end-system and network configurations with both stereo and multi-view streaming, the simulation results demonstrate that our algorithms outperform others in terms of streaming quality, stream synchronization/smoothness and scalability.

Bandwidth allocation in BitTorrent-like VoD systems under flashcrowds###The efficiency of BitTorrent in content distribution has inspired a number of peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols for on-demand video (VoD) streaming systems (henceforth BitTorrent-like VoD systems). However, the fundamental quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of VoD (i.e. providing peers with a smooth playback continuity and a short startup delay) make the design of these systems more challenging than normal file-sharing systems. In particular, the bandwidth allocation strategy is an important aspect in the design of BitTorrent-like VoD systems, which becomes even more crucial in a scenario where a large number of peers joins in a short period of time, a phenomenon known as flashcrowd. In fact, the new joining peers all demand for content while having few or no pieces of content to offer in return yet. An unwise allocation of the limited bandwidth actually available during this phase may cause peers to experience poor QoS. In this work, we analyze the effects of a flashcrowd on the scalability of a BitTorrent-like VoD system and propose a number of mechanisms to make the bandwidth allocation in this phase more effective. In particular, we derive an upper bound for the number of peers that can be admitted in the system over time and we find that there is a trade-off between having the seeders minimize the upload of pieces already injected recently and high peer QoS. Based on the insights gained from our analysis, we devise some flashcrowd-handling algorithms for the allocation of peer bandwidth to improve peer QoS during flashcrowd. We validate the effectiveness of our proposals by means of extensive simulations.

Hose rate control for P2P-TV streaming systems###In this paper we consider mesh based P2P streaming systems focusing on the problem of regulating peer upload rate to match the system demand while not overloading each peer upload link capacity. We propose Hose Rate Control (HRC), a novel scheme to control the speed at which peers offer chunks to other peers, ultimately controlling peer uplink capacity utilization. This is of critical importance for heterogeneous scenarios like the one faced in the Internet, where peer upload capacity is unknown and varies widely. HRC nicely adapts to the actual peer available upload bandwidth and system demand, so that users' Quality of Experience is greatly enhanced. Both simulations and actual experiments involving up to 1000 peers are presented to assess performance in real scenarios. Results show that HRC consistently outperforms the Quality of Experience achieved by non-adaptive schemes.

Measurements on the spotify peer-assisted music-on-demand streaming system###Spotify is a streaming service offering low-latency access to a large library of music. Streaming is performed by a combination of client-server access and a peer-to-peer protocol. The service currently has a user base of over 10 million and is available in seven European countries. We provide a background on the Spotify protocol with emphasis on the formation of the peer-to-peer overlay. Using measurement data collected over a week by instrumenting Spotify clients, we analyze general network properties such as the correspondence between individual user accounts and the number of IP addresses they connect from and the prevalence of Network Address Translation devices (NATs). We also discuss the performance of one of the two peer discovery mechanisms used by Spotify.

Measurements, Analysis and Modeling of Private Trackers###BitTorrent plays a very important role in the current Internet content distribution. The enormous impact of public and private trackers should not be overlooked. Public trackers are suffering from free-riding problem, but private trackers are becoming more and more popular and they run very well in terms of an effective Share Ratio Enforcement (SRE) which is an auxiliary incentive mechanism. In this paper, we have crawled and traced 15 trackers with 3.5 million torrents for over 6 months. We first provide taxonomy of private trackers, and then present in breadth and depth measurement from the user viscosity, torrents evolution, user behaviors, content distribution and other metrics. Some features are apparently different from public trackers. Furthermore, we analyze SRE mechanism and point/credit system, and use game theory to study the effectiveness of SRE. There exists "uploading starvation" phenomenon in private trackers. We model SRE mechanism and preliminary propose an improved SRE mechanism to further incent users and enhance the performance of private trackers.

IMP: ISP-Managed P2P###Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have failed to independently reduce the cost peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic. Traffic- throttling devices increase user download times, and caches store content that may infringe copyright. We propose ISP-Managed P2P (IMP): a transparent peer-discovery service that returns peers favorable to ISPs. Unlike similar services, IMP does not require the direct support of developers who have no incentive to cooperate. This paper covers the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of our IMP prototype, which reduces costly, cross-ISP traffic by eight times without significantly increasing user download times.

Can P2P-Users Benefit from Locality-Awareness?###Locality-awareness is considered as a promising approach to increase the efficiency of content distribution by peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, e.g., BitTorrent. It is intended to reduce the inter-domain traffic which is costly for Internet service providers (ISPs) and simultaneously increase the performance from the viewpoint of the P2P users, i.e, shorten download times. This win-win situation should be achieved by a preferred exchange of information between peers which are located closely to each other in the underlying network topology. A set of studies shows that these approaches can lead to a win-win situation under certain conditions, and to a win-no lose situation in most cases. However, the scenarios used assume mostly homogeneous peer distributions and that all peers have the same access speed. This is not the case in practice according to several measurement studies. Therefore, we extend previous work in this paper by studying scenarios with real-life, skewed peer distributions and heterogeneous access bandwidths of peers. We show that even a win-no lose situation is difficult to achieve under those conditions and that the actual impact for a specific peer depends heavily on the used locality-aware peer selection and the concrete scenario. Therefore, we conclude that current proposals need to be refined so that users of P2P networks can be sure that they also benefit from their use. Otherwise, a broad acceptance of the concept of locality-awareness in the user community of P2P networks will not take place.

Verifiable Encryption for P2P Block Exchange###Free-riding is an important problem in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing networks. When peers refuse to contribute upload bandwidth, the whole network can collapse. A relatively new free-riding vulnerability in BitTorrent is the Large View Exploit, in which a peer connects to as many other peers as possible to increase the chance to get free data. This exploit can not be thwarted by tit-for-tat-like mechanisms which have traditionally been used to ban free-riding. Several approaches have been proposed to combat the Large View Exploit in fully decentralized systems, most of which rely on encryption. However, the use of regular encryption makes it impossible to verify the correctness of received data. In this paper we propose a novel encryption method which does allow verification of the plaintext data without decryption, at the expense of encryption strength. We show that a colluding peer still has to send data that is at least 40% of the size of the original data to allow decryption.

Cryptographically Enforced Permissions for Fully Decentralized File Systems###Distributed file systems nowadays work well in many ways. They provide efficient solutions, for example, to distribute data among a global team. But most systems do not address the complex subject of secure user and group management. The systems that do, usually offer only a very limited subset of access permissions that is incompatible to the permissions usually used in Unix-like systems. In this paper, we propose a new system for user and group management, which cryptographically enforces access permissions in fully decentralized file systems. Our proposal is twofold: an integrity verification algorithm checks the validity of the current file system state; a cryptographic data protection scheme, added on top of the integrity verification, preserves the privacy of the file system content. Except for signatures, our system uses symmetric cryptography only. It thus incurs only a reasonable cryptographic cost in the system.

Unraveling BitTorrent's File Unavailability: Measurements and Analysis###BitTorrent suffers from one fundamental problem: the long-term availability of content. This occurs on a massive-scale with 38% of torrents becoming unavailable within the first month. In this paper we explore this problem by performing two large-scale measurement studies including 46K torrents and 29M users. The studies go significantly beyond any previous work by combining per-node, per-torrent and system-wide observations to ascertain the causes, characteristics and repercussions of file unavailability. The study confirms the conclusion from previous works that seeders have a significant impact on both performance and availability. However, we also present some crucial new findings: (i) the presence of seeders is not the sole factor involved in file availability, (ii) 23.5% of nodes that operate in seedless torrents can finish their downloads, and (iii) BitTorrent availability is discontinuous, operating in cycles of temporary unavailability.

Autonomous NAT Traversal###Traditional NAT traversal methods require the help of a third party for signalling. This paper investigates a new autonomous method for establishing connections to peers behind NAT. The proposed method for autonomous NAT traversal uses fake ICMP messages to initially contact the NATed peer. This paper presents how the method is supposed to work in theory, discusses some possible variations, introduces various concrete implementations of the proposed approach and evaluates empirical results of a measurement study designed to evaluate the efficacy of the idea in practice.

Measurement and Analysis of BitTorrent Traffic in Mobile WiMAX Networks###As mobile Internet environments are becoming dominant, how to revamp P2P operations for mobile hosts is gaining more and more attention. In this paper, we carry out empirical traffic measurement of BitTorrent service in various settings (static, bus and subway) in commercial WiMAX networks. To this end, we analyze the connectivity among peers, the download throughput/stability, and the signaling overhead of mobile WiMAX hosts in comparison to a wired (Ethernet) host. We find out the drawbacks of BitTorrent operations in mobile Internet are characterized by lower connection ratio, unstable connections amongst peers, and higher control message overhead.

The Impact of Caching on BitTorrent-Like Peer-to-Peer Systems###Peer-to-peer file-sharing systems are responsible for a significant share of the traffic between Internet service providers (ISPs) in the Internet. In order to decrease their peer-to-peer related transit traffic costs, many ISPs have deployed caches for peer-to-peer traffic in recent years. We consider how the different types of peer-to-peer caches - caches already available on the market and caches expected to become available in the future - can possibly affect the amount of inter-ISP traffic. We develop a fluid model that captures the effects of the caches on the system dynamics of peer-to-peer networks, and show that caches can have adverse effects on the system dynamics depending on the system parameters. We combine the fluid model with a simple model of inter-ISP traffic and show that the impact of caches cannot be accurately assessed without considering the effects of the caches on the system dynamics. We identify scenarios when caching actually leads to increased transit traffic. Our analytical results are supported by extensive simulations and experiments with real BitTorrent clients.

Waiting for Anonymity: Understanding Delays in the Tor Overlay###Although Tor is the most widely used overlay for providing anonymity services, its users often experience very high delays. Because much of Tor usage is for Web applications, which are sensitive to latency, it is critical to reduce delays in Tor. To take an important step in this direction, we seek an in-depth understanding of delays in Tor. By taking snapshots of the entire Tor network within a short time window, we are able to study the delay distribution of the entire router population. We also monitor delays introduced by individual Tor routers over extended periods of time. Our results indicate that apart from delays introduced by routers, overlay network latency also plays a significant role in delays in Tor. We have also observed that at any time, there exist huge differences in the delays introduced by different routers. Our results reveal key performance characteristics of Tor system behavior and provide valuable insights for improving the Tor performance.

ASAP Top-k Query Processing in Unstructured P2P Systems###Top-k query processing techniques are useful in unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, to avoid overwhelming users with too many results. However, existing approaches suffer from long waiting times. This is because top-k results are returned only when all queried peers have finished processing the query. As a result, query response time is dominated by the slowest queried peer. In this paper, we address this users' waiting time problem. For this, we revisit top-k query processing in P2P systems by introducing two novel notions in addition to response time: the stabilization time and the cumulative quality gap. Using these notions, we formally define the as-soon-as-possible (ASAP) top-k processing problem. Then, we propose a family of algorithms called ASAP to deal with this problem. We validate our solution through implementation and extensive experimentation. The results show that ASAP significantly outperforms baseline algorithms by re- turning final top-k result to users in much better times.

Performance Evaluation of Peer-to-Peer Gaming Overlays###In this demo we present a performance evaluation testbed for peer-to-peer gaming overlays. It consists of a 3D first person shooter game that is designed to run in a simulated network environment as well as on a real network. Simulation with autonomous players (bots) guarantees scalability, a controlled workload, and reproducible results; a prototype deployment on a real network can then validate the simulation results. The information dissemination overlay pSense is implemented as a first subject for evaluation.

Do BitTorrent-Like VoD Systems Scale under Flash-Crowds?###The efficiency of BitTorrent for file sharing has inspired a number of BitTorrent-based P2P protocols for Video-on-Demand (VoD). It has been shown that these systems are scalable in steady-state: the service quality provided to the users does not depend on the number of users in the system. However, it is not well understood how these systems scale under flash-crowds. In this work, we model a general BitTorrent-like VoD system and we find that under a flash-crowd the quality-of-service (QoS) degrades with the number of users. Also, our analysis shows that, at the very beginning of a flash-crowd, the maximum number of simultaneous users that can obtain a given service level is intrinsically related to two fundamental system parameters, namely the initial service capacity and the efficiency of piece exchange of the underlying P2P protocol. Finally, we illustrate the impact of peers turning into seeders (i.e peers that have finished downloading and remain in the system to upload) on the system scale.

Analyzing the DC File Sharing Network###This paper investigates the Direct Connect (DC) file sharing network, which to the best of our knowledge, has never been academically studied before. We developed a participating agent, in order to gather protocol specific information. We quantify network characteristics such as distribution of users in hubs, hubs geography, queries distribution and trends in shared folder size. We also characterize the typical DC user: A heavy downloader with a particularly large shared folder. Most importantly, we discovered a query duplications problem that drains much of the hubs CPU and bandwidth resources. In the DC network, query facilitation is the most demanding task for hubs and the main factor in the protocol's scalability challenges. We show that in some hubs, up to a third of the queries traffic is duplicated and therefore wasteful. Resolving this problem will dramatically improve hubs performances by reducing the amount of relayed queries and thus permitting larger hub communities.

Can Realistic BitTorrent Experiments Be Performed on Clusters?###Network latency and packet loss are considered to be an important requirement for realistic evaluation of Peer-to-Peer protocols. Dedicated clusters, such as Grid'5000, do not provide the variety of network latency and packet loss rates that can be found in the Internet. However, compared to the experiments performed on testbeds such as PlanetLab, the experiments performed on dedicated clusters are reproducible, as the computational resources are not shared. In this paper, we perform experiments to study the impact of network latency and packet loss on the time required to download a file using BitTorrent. In our experiments, we observe a less than 15% increase on the time required to download a file when we increase the round-trip time between any two peers, from 0 ms to 400 ms, and the packet loss rate, from 0% to 5%. Our main conclusion is that the underlying network latency and packet loss have a marginal impact on the time required to download a file using BitTorrent. Hence, dedicated clusters such as Grid'5000 can be safely used to perform realistic and reproducible BitTorrent experiments.

Towards Plugging Privacy Leaks in the Domain Name System###Privacy leaks are an unfortunate and an integral part of the current Internet domain name resolution. Each DNS query generated by a user reveals -- to one or more DNS servers -- the origin and the target of that query. Over time, users' communication (e.g., browsing) patterns might become exposed to entities with little or no trust. Current DNS privacy leaks stem from fundamental features of DNS and are not easily fixable by simple patches. Moreover, privacy issues have been overlooked by DNS security efforts (such as DNSSEC) and are thus likely to propagate into future versions of DNS. In order to mitigate privacy issues in DNS, this paper proposes a Privacy-Preserving DNS (PPDNS), that offers privacy during domain name resolution. PPDNS is based on distributed hash tables (DHTs), an alternative naming infrastructure, and computational private information retrieval (cPIR), an advanced cryptographic construct. PPDNS takes advantage of the DHT index structure to provide name resolution query privacy, while leveraging cPIR to reduce communication overhead for bandwidth-sensitive clients. Our analysis shows that PPDNS is a viable approach for obtaining a reasonably high level of privacy for name resolution queries. PPDNS also serves as a demonstration of blending advanced systems techniques with their cryptographic counterparts.

Technical Assessment and Deployment Considerations of Economic Traffic Management Mechanisms###This paper presents the technical assessment of the Economic Traffic Management (ETM) mechanisms that have been specified and implemented in the EU FP7 SmoothIT (Simple Economic Management Approaches of Overlay Traffic in Heterogeneous Internet Topologies) project. The proposal inter-relates traditional mechanisms of network management with economic incentives. The most relevant ETM mechanisms are being implemented in an architectural framework for integrating ETM into today's ISP networks. This implementation architecture is outlined and it forms the ground for the technical assessment of the proposed methods whose main goals are to validate the effectiveness of the locality mechanisms as a way to reduce network costs and to improve the quality experienced by overlay users and the scalability validation of the proposed solution.

Hivory: Range Queries on Hierarchical Voronoi Overlays###The problem of defining a support for multidimensional range queries on P2P overlays is currently an active field of research. Several approaches based on the extension of the basic functionalities offered by Distributed Hash Tables have been recently proposed. The main drawback of these approaches is that the locality required for the resolution of a range query cannot be guaranteed by uniform hashing. On the other way, locality preserving hashing functions do not guarantee a good level of load balancing. This paper presents Hivory, a P2P overlay based on a Voronoi tessellation defined by the objects published by peers. Each object is mapped to a site of the Voronoi tessellation and the corresponding Delaunay Triangulation defines the P2P overlay. A hierarchy of Voronoi diagrams is defined by exploiting clusters of objects paired with the same site of the Voronoi diagram. A new Voronoi diagram including the peers of the cluster is created so that the query resolution may be refined by a top down visit of the Voronoi hierarchy. The paper presents the proposed solution, analysis its complexity, and provides a set of experimental results.

LifeSocial.KOM: A P2P-Based Platform for Secure Online Social Networks###Online social networks with millions of users are very popular nowadays. They provide a platform for the users to present themselves and to interact with each other. In this paper, we present a totally distributed platform for social online networks based on the p2p paradigm, called LifeSocial.KOM. It provides the same functionality as common online social networks, while distributing the operational load on all participating nodes. LifeSocial.KOM is plugin-based and extendible, provides secure communication and user-based data access control and integrates a monitoring component which allows the users and operators to observe the quality of the distributed system.

Availability and Redundancy in Harmony: Measuring Retrieval Times in P2P Storage Systems###Peer-to-peer (P2P) storage systems are strongly affected by churn - temporal and permanent peer failures. Because of this churn, the main requirement of such systems is to guarantee that stored objects can always be retrieved. This requirement is specially needed in two main situations: when users want to access the stored objects or when data maintenance processes have to repair lost information. To meet this requirement, exiting P2P storage systems introduce large amounts of redundancy that maintain data availability close to 100%. Unfortunately, these large amounts of redundancy increase the storage costs, either by reducing the overall net capacity or by increasing the communication required for data maintenance. In order to minimize storage costs, P2P storage systems can reduce data redundancy. However, less redundancy means lower data availability, which leads to increase object retrieval times. Unfortunately, longer retrieval times could compromise data maintenance processes and could penalize user's retrieval times. It is crucial then for P2P storage systems to predict the effects of a redundancy reduction. In order to provide this information, we present a novel analytical framework to measure object retrieval times under different redundancy and churn circumstances. Our framework can be directly used by backup applications aiming to maintain durability at the lower cost, or by data sharing applications that seek to reduce costs by penalizing user retrieval times. We validate our framework by simulation using real P2P traces (Skype and eMule's KAD).

Boosting Gossip for Live Streaming###Gossip protocols are considered very effective to disseminate information in a large scale dynamic distributed system. Their inherent simplicity makes them easy to implement and deploy. However, whereas their probabilistic guarantees are often enough to disseminate data in the context of low- bandwidth applications, they typically do not suffice for high-bandwidth content dissemination: missing 1% is unacceptable for live streaming. In this paper, we show how the combination of two simple mechanisms copes with this seemingly inherent deficiency of gossip: (i) codec, an erasure coding scheme, and (ii) claim<sup>2</sup>, a content- request scheme that leverages gossip duplication to diversify the retransmission sources of missing information. We show how these mechanisms can effectively complement each other in a new gossip protocol, gossip++, which retains the simplicity of deployment of plain gossip. In a realistic setting with an average bandwidth capability (800 kbps) close to the stream rate (680 kbps) and 1% message loss, plain gossip can provide at most 99% of the stream. Using gossip++, on the other hand, all nodes can view a perfectly clear stream.

Online Data Backup: A Peer-Assisted Approach###In this work we study the benefits of a peer- assisted approach to online backup applications, in which spare bandwidth and storage space of end- hosts complement that of an online storage service. Via simulations, we analyze the interplay between two key aspects of such applications: data placement and bandwidth allocation. Our analysis focuses on metrics such as the time required to complete a backup and a restore operation, as well as the storage costs. We show that, by using adequate bandwidth allocation policies in which storage space at a cloud provider can be used temporarily, hybrid systems can achieve performance comparable to traditional client-server architectures at a fraction of the costs. Moreover, we explore the impact of mechanisms to impose fairness and conclude that a peer-assisted approach does not discriminate peers in terms of performance, but associates a storage cost to peers contributing with little resources.

Spotify -- Large Scale, Low Latency, P2P Music-on-Demand Streaming###Spotify is a music streaming service offering low-latency access to a library of over 8 million music tracks. Streaming is performed by a combination of client-server access and a peer-to-peer protocol. In this paper, we give an overview of the protocol and peer-to-peer architecture used and provide measurements of service performance and user behavior. The service currently has a user base of over 7 million and has been available in six European countries since October 2008. Data collected indicates that the combination of the client-server and peer-to-peer paradigms can be applied to music streaming with good results. In particular, 8.8% of music data played comes from Spotify's servers while the median playback latency is only 265 ms (including cached tracks). We also discuss the user access patterns observed and how the peer-to-peer network affects the access patterns as they reach the server.

NAP: An Agent-Based Scheme on Reducing Churn-Induced Delays for P2P Live Streaming###Peer-to-peer (P2P) multimedia streaming provides a scalable solution for IPTV. However, delays from channel switch and streaming recovery are typically in the scale of 10-60 seconds, which have hindered the extensive commercial deployment of P2P systems. We call these two types of delays, churn-induced delays. Obtaining assurances on churn-induced delays in dynamic and heterogeneous network environments is a challenge. In this paper, we devise a simple, yet efficient agent-based P2P streaming scheme, called NAP, which reduces churn-induced delays. We first formulate the problems of minimizing channel-switching delay and streaming recovery delay. We then present the detailed methodology of NAP. In addition, we develop a queuing model for the P2P streaming scenario and analyze the properties of NAP based on this model. Our numerical study reveals the effectiveness of NAP, and shows that NAP significantly reduces churn-induced delays, especially channel-switching delays.

Addressing the P2P Bootstrap Problem for Small Overlay Networks###Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlays provide a framework for building distributed applications consisting of few to many resources with features including self-configuration, scalability, and resilience to node failures. Such systems have been successfully adopted in large-scale Internet services for content delivery networks, file sharing, and data storage. In small-scale systems, they can be useful to address privacy concerns as well as support for network applications that lack dedicated servers. The bootstrap problem, finding an existing peer in the overlay, remains a challenge to enabling these services for small-scale P2P systems. In large networks, the solution to the bootstrap problem has been the use of dedicated services, though creating and maintaining these systems requires expertise and resources, which constrain their usefulness and make them unappealing for small-scale systems. This paper surveys and summarizes requirements that allow peers potentially constrained by network connectivity to bootstrap small-scale overlays through the use of existing public overlays. In order to support bootstrapping, a public overlay must support the following requirements: a method for reflection in order to obtain publicly reachable addresses, so peers behind network address translators and firewalls can receive incoming connection requests; communication relaying to share public addresses and communicate when direct communication is not feasible; and rendezvous for discovering remote peers, when the overlay lacks stable membership. After presenting a survey of various public overlays, we identify two overlays that match the requirements: XMPP overlays, such as Google Talk and Live Journal Talk, and Brunet, a structured overlay based upon Symphony. We present qualitative experiences with prototypes that demonstrate the ability to bootstrap small-scale private structured overlays from public Brunet or XMPP infrastructures.

SPADS: Publisher Anonymization for DHT Storage###Many distributed applications, such as collaborative Web mapping, collaborative feedback and ranking, or bug reporting systems, rely on the aggregation of privacy-sensitive information gathered from human users. This information is typically aggregated at servers and later used as the basis for some collaborative service. Expecting that clients trust that the user-centric information will not be used for malevolent purposes is not realistic in a fully distributed setting where nodes are not under the control of a single administrative domain. Moreover, most of the time the origin of the data is of small importance when computing the aggregation onto which these services are based. Trust problems can be evinced by ensuring that the identity of the user is dropped before the data can actually be used, a process called publisher anonymization. Such a property shall be guaranteed even if a set of servers is colluding to spy on some user. This also requires that malevolent users cannot harm the service by sending any number of items without being traceable due to publisher anonymization. Rate limitation and decoupled authentication are the two mechanisms that ensure that these cheating users have a limited impact on the system. This paper presents SPADS, a system that interfaces to any DHT and supports the three objectives of publisher anonymization, rate limitation and decoupled authentication. The evaluation of a deployed prototype on a cluster assesses its performance and small footprint.

Online Video Using BitTorrent and HTML5 Applied to Wikipedia###Wikipedia started a project in order to enable users to add video and audio on their Wiki pages. The technical downside of this is that its bandwidth requirements will increase manifold. BitTorrent-based peer-to-peer technology from P2P-Next (a European research project) is explored to handle this bandwidth surge. We discuss the impact on the BitTorrent piece picker and outline our ''tribe'' protocol for seamless integration of P2P into the HTML5 video and audio elements. Ongoing work on libswift which uses UDP, an enhanced transport protocol and integrated NAT/Firewall puncturing, is also described.

Distributed Access Enforcement in P2P Networks: When Privacy Comes into Play###In open environments such as peer-to-peer networks, the decision to collaborate with multiple users (e.g., by granting access to a resource) is hard to achieve in practice due to extreme decentralization. The literature contains a plethora of examples where a scalable solution for access control is basic to spur their adoption.Motivated by this need, we introduce a novel protocol to enforce access control in a distributed but also privacy-preserving manner - i.e., so as to minimize the disclosure of privileges and of access policies. Privacy is rather scarce in peer-to-peer systems, for which we believe that our protocol is a valuable contribution. Using extensive simulations on top of real Internet topologies, we illustrate the applicability of our protocol, which is efficient both in terms of communication and rounds of interaction.

A QoE-Aware P2P Streaming System Using Scalable Video Coding###P2P streaming has attracted much attention recently with promises for higher revenues and better load distribution. Still, the majority of P2P video streaming systems today employ the one-size-fits-all concept where the same video bit-rate is offered to all users. Here the promising H.264/Scalable Video Coding (SVC) standard is seen as a necessity in not only supporting heterogeneous resources, but also in reducing the impact of P2P dynamics on the perceived Quality-of-Experience (QoE). In this demonstration we present our streaming application that uses SVC to adapt to different user requirements and resources. The application employs a novel QoE- aware layer selection algorithm that maximizes flexibility through SVC while taking impact on QoE into consideration.

WhatsUp: News, From, For, Through, Everyone###WhatsUp (WUP) is a new form of electronic news. It is personalized and decentralized. Users receive news and have the ability to express their interest in it. This opinion, in turn, is used as an implicit and dynamic subscription scheme to filter and personalize future information. The system is peer-to-peer: no big brother company controls the news, and no central server makes it vulnerable to failures, censorship or attacks. At the heart of WUP lies the idea of collaborative filtering applied to the dissemination of news: people who liked the same news in the past might as well like the same news in the future: irrelevant news disappear by themselves. The idea is put to work through Beep: a biased epidemic dissemination (gossip) protocol that delivers news to interested users in a timely manner, despite jamming and churn. Beep is dynamically parameterized on a per- user, per-news, and per-dissemination-hop basis. When compared to a classical epidemic dissemination protocol, Beep has two key characteristics: orientation and amplification. Every user forwards the news of interest to a randomly selected set of users largely constituted by those who have similar interests (orientation). Moreover, the size of this set of users depends on the level of interest in the news itself (amplification).

Affluenza: Towards Universal Churn Generation###Churn is an inherent property of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Despite its relevance, yet, there is not a universal tool to bring researchers the opportunity to compare their contributions under the same general conditions. To fill this gap, we present the first open-source, simulator-independent tool for churn modeling.

Network Friendly P2P-TV: The Napa-Wine Approach###P2P-TV systems have become part of the Internet landscape. The architecture of these (normally proprietary) applications is generally receiver-driven, in that receivers actively search for suitable peers to download from, trying to maximize their performance. The Napa-Wine EU project proposes an architecture where P2P-TV clients exploit network measures to reduce their network footprint and, if available, exploit ALTO-like services to optimize topology and performance, and to minimize the overall network load. The Topology Management and Chunk Trading are implemented on top of a set of generic libraries (GRAPES Generic Resource Aware P2P Environment for Streaming) which provide all the basic functionalities needed for peer sampling, for chunk scheduling, for exchanging buffer maps and chunk ID sets, for sending and receiving chunks, etc.

Integrated Measurement and Analysis of P2P Streaming Traffic by the Java Tool Atheris###Currently, the rapid development of new multimedia services including VoIP, video streaming and video on demand as well as IPTV and the integration of triple play into the service portfolios of ISPs and network operators indicate an evolutionary path towards next generation networking. Peer-topeer (P2P) overlay networks are used with growing intensity to implement the content dissemination and control planes of many new portals and their multimedia service components like GoalBit, Zattoo, PPLive, SopCast, Voddler or Skype. However, despite intensive measurement campaigns (cf. [3], [4] among others), publicly available integrated systems to monitor streaming traffic in such networks and to analyze its features are rarely provided yet. The presented JAVA tool Atheris constitutes an approach to overcome this deficiency.

Understanding Peer Exchange in BitTorrent Systems###Peer Exchange (PEX), in which peers directly exchange with each other lists of active peers in the torrent, has been widely implemented in modern BitTorrent clients for decentralized peer discovery. However, there is little knowledge about the behavior of PEX in operational systems. In this paper, we perform both passive measurements and Planetlab experiments to study the impact and properties of BitTorrent PEX. We first study the impact of PEX on the download efficiency of BitTorrent. We observe that PEX can significantly reduce the download time for some torrents. We then analyze the freshness, redundancy and spread speed of PEX messages. Finally, we also conduct large- scale Planetlab experiments to understand the impact of PEX on the overlay properties of BitTorrent.

QoE in Pull Based P2P-TV Systems: Overlay Topology Design Tradeoffs###This paper presents a systematic performance analysis of pull P2P video streaming systems for live applications, providing guidelines for the design of the overlay topology and the chunk scheduling algorithm. The contribution of the paper is threefold: (1) we propose a realistic simulative model of the system that represents the effects of access bandwidth heterogeneity, latencies, peculiar characteristics of the video, while still guaranteeing good scalability properties; (2) we propose a new latency/bandwidth-aware overlay topology design strategy that improves application layer performance while reducing the underlying transport network stress; (3) we investigate the impact of chunk scheduling algorithms that explicitly exploit properties of encoded video. Results show that our proposal jointly improves the actual Quality of Experience of users and reduces the cost the transport network has to support.

PeerDedupe: Insights into the Peer-Assisted Sampling Deduplication###As the digital data rapidly inflates to a world-wide storage crisis, data deduplication is showing its increasingly prominent function in data storage. Driven by the problems behind the mainstream server-side deduplication schemes, recently there has been a tendency of introducing peer-assisted methods into the deduplication systems. However, this topic is still quite vague at present and lacks thorough research. In this paper, we conduct in-depth and quantitative investigation on the peer-assisted deduplication. Through measurements we observe that the inter-peer duplication accounts for a large proportion of the total duplication, and exhibits strong peer locality. Then based on our observations, we propose PeerDedupe, a novel peer-assisted sampling deduplication approach. Experiments show that PeerDedupe can remove over 98% duplication with each peer coordinating with no more than 5 other peers, and it requires much less server RAM usage than the existing works.

Multi-Source Scheduling in Streaming Erasure-Coded Video over P2P Networks###The efficient scheduling of streaming data delivery in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a hard problem due to the Internet's lack of support for resource allocation and performance guarantees. In particular, the bandwidth resources available to a peer is constantly in flux and the future bandwidth availability is very difficult, if not impossible, to predict accurately. This work proposes to tackle this problem from a different angle. We investigate the use of erasure codes to encode the media data and then schedule multiple peers to stream the encoded data simultaneously to a receiver. By exploiting the order-invariant property of erasure codes this approach enables the sending peers to fully utilize their available bandwidth resources and yet does not need to estimate or predict their bandwidth availability. Moreover, we develop distributed scheduling algorithms to juxtapose the data transmissions from multiple peers so that the coding and storage complexities can be kept at practical level in scaling up the system. This paper describes the motivation, architecture, and design of the proposed coding/scheduling algorithms; develops a performance model to characterize the algorithms' performance bounds; and evaluates them through simulation as well as experiments.

On Tracker Selection for Peer-to-Peer Traffic Locality###BitTorrent (BT) is an extremely successful peer-to-peer (P2P) application providing efficient file sharing over the Internet. The ever-increasing traffic among the peers has also put unprecedented pressure to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). P2P locality has therefore been widely suggested, which explores finding local resources to optimize the cross-ISP/AS traffic. However, the ISPs would fail to reduce the cross-AS traffic if they could not control the neighbor selection of their P2P subscribers. In this paper, we examine the applicability of P2P locality through real-world measurement. We find that the widely deployed load balance trackers will greatly reduce the efficiency of traffic locality. Due to peers' random tracker selection, there is no grantee that the peers will always choose the modified trackers as we expected. To make the matter worse, some Internet trackers involve serious copyright violation and may hardly cooperate with the ISPs. Fortunately, our investigation of the AS-Tracker relationship indicates that if we carefully select the trackers during the locality deployment, most peers can still be controlled by the ISPs with relatively high probability. A machine learning based model is then proposed to quantify the similarity of trackers' peer distribution. Our trace-based simulation shows that, the similarity value can provide useful hints to enhance P2P locality. In particular, the peers are more likely to be optimized with higher probability. Moreover, the learning of tracker similarity does not require the global knowledge of Internet trackers, which can hardly be obtained by the individual ISPs.

On the Privacy of Peer-Assisted Distribution of Security Patches###When a host discovers that it has a software vulnerability that is susceptible to an attack, the host needs to obtain and install a patch. Because centralized distribution of patches may not scale well, peer-to-peer (P2P) approaches have recently been suggested. There is, however, a serious privacy problem with peer-assisted patch distribution: when a peer A requests a patch from another peer B, it announces to B its vulnerability, which B can exploit instead of providing the patch. Through analytical modeling and simulation, we show that a large majority of vulnerable hosts will typically become compromised with a basic design for peer- assisted patch distribution. We then study the effectiveness of two different approaches in countering this privacy problem. The first approach utilizes special-purpose peer nodes, referred to as honeypots, that discover and blacklist malicious peers listening for patch requests from susceptible hosts. In the second approach, the patches are requested through an anonymizing network, hiding the identities of susceptible hosts from malicious peers. Using analytical models and simulation, we show that, honeypots do not completely solve the privacy problem; in contrast, an anonymizing network turns out to be more suitable for security patch distribution.

Spring for Vivaldi -- Orchestrating Hierarchical Network Coordinates###Network coordinates have become an important building block for efficient peer-to-peer applications. They allow the peers to determine those other peers to whom they are likely to experience a low round trip time. So they can preferably attach to these selected peers and thereby create efficient overlay structures. Despite the substantial interest in this topic, there is still room for improvement. In this paper we propose Hierarchical Vivaldi, a variant of the popular Vivaldi algorithm. It predicts the peers' embedding error so that it can optimize the peer selection process. We conducted extensive studies with several sets of Internet traffic traces. They compare our proposal to Vivaldi and its previously proposed optimizations. Our results show that Hierarchical Vivaldi can improve the accuracy of the RTT predictions by an order of magnitude.

Optimizing Near Duplicate Detection for P2P Networks###In this paper, we propose a probabilistic algorithm for detecting near duplicate text, audio, and video resources efficiently and effectively in large-scale P2P systems. To this end, we present a thorough cost and probabilistic analysis that allows the algorithm to adapt to network and data collection characteristics for minimizing network cost. In addition, we extend the algorithm so that it can identify similar videos, even if some of the videos are split into different files. A thorough theoretical analysis as well as a large-scale experimental evaluation on networks of up to 100,000 peers using real-world datasets of more than 200 Gbytes demonstrate the viability of our approach.

Local Access to Sparse and Large Global Information in P2P Networks: A Case for Compressive Sensing###In this paper we face the following problem: how to provide each peer local access to the full information (not just a summary) that is distributed over all emph{edges} of an overlay network? How can this be done if local access is performed at a given rate? We focus on emph{large and sparse} information and we propose to exploit the compressive sensing (CS) theory to efficiently collect and pro-actively disseminate this information across a large overlay network. We devise an approach based on random walks (RW) to spread CS random combinations to participants in a random peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network. CS allows the peer to compress the RW payload in a distributed fashion: given a constraint on the RW size, e.g., the maximum UDP packet payload size, this amounts to being able to distribute larger information and to guarantee that a large fraction of the global information is obtained by each peer. We analyze the performance of the proposed method by means of a simple (yet accurate) analytical model describing the structure of the so called CS sensing matrix in presence of peer dynamics and communication link failures. We validate our model predictions against a simulator of the system at the peer and network level on different models of random overlay networks. The model we developed can be exploited to select the parameters of the RW and the criteria to build the sensing matrix in order to achieve successful information recovery. Finally, a prototype has been developed and deployed over the PlanetLab network to prove the feasibility of the proposed approach in a realistic environment. Our analysis reveals that the method we propose is feasible, accurate and robust to peer and information dynamics. We also argue that centralized and other distributed approaches, i.e., flooding and gossiping, are unfit in the context we consider.

Improving Accuracy and Coverage in an Internet-Deployed Reputation Mechanism###P2P systems can benefit from reputation mechanisms to promote cooperation and help peers to identify good service providers. However, in spite of a large number of proposed reputation mechanisms, few have been investigated in real situations. BarterCast is a distributed reputation mechanism used by our Internet-deployed Bittorent-based file-sharing client Tribler. In BarterCast, each peer uses messages received from other peers to build a weighted, directed subjective graph that represents the upload and download activity in the system. A peer calculates the reputations of other peers by applying the maxflow algorithm to its subjective graph. For efficiency reasons, only paths of at most two hops are considered in this calculation. In this paper, we identify and assess three potential modifications to BarterCast for improving its accuracy and coverage (fraction of peers for which a reputation value can be computed). First, a peer executes maxflow from the perspective of the node with the highest betweenness centrality in its subjective graph instead of itself. Second, we assume a gossiping protocol that gives each peer complete information about upload and download activities in the system, and third, we lift the path length restriction in the maxflow algorithm. To assess these modifications, we crawl the Tribler network and collect the upload and download actions of the peers for three months. We apply BarterCast with and without the modifications on the collected data and measure accuracy and coverage.

BitMON: A Tool for Automated Monitoring of the BitTorrent DHT###The distributed hash table (DHT) formed by BitTorrent has become very popular as a basis for various kinds of services. Services based on this DHT often assume certain characteristics of the DHT. For instance, for realizing a decentralized bootstrapping service a minimum number of peers running on a certain port are required. However, key characteristics change over time. Our measurements show that e.g. the number of concurrent users grew from 5 to over 7 millions of users during the last months. For making reliable assumptions it is thus essential to monitor the P2P network. This demo presents BitMON, a Java-based out-of-the-box platform for monitoring the BitTorrent DHT. This tool does not only crawl the network, but also automatically analyzes the collected data and visualizes the results. BitMON monitors the DHT's size in peers as well as the peers' IP addresses, port numbers, countries of origin and session length. Also, the long-term evolution of these indicators can be graphically displayed. Furthermore, BitMON is designed as a framework and can easily be extended or adapted to monitor other P2P networks.

radioActive WiFi Sharing for Autonomous Peers###WiFi sharing communities offer an attractive alternative to commercial hot-spots and cellular networks for users who seek Internet access while being away from home. The growing number of mobile devices with Internet usage capabilities has formed a basis for the establishment and growth of several such communities. However, critical security problems exist in all current WiFi sharing approaches because they employ a central operator. We show how to overcome these issues by decentralizing the community's organization structure and present radioActive WiFi, a system that implements this approach.

Pushing the performance of Biased Neighbor Selection through Biased Unchoking###Locality promotion in P2P content distribution networks is currently a major research topic. One of the goals of all discussed approaches is to reduce the interdomain traffic that causes high costs for ISPs. However, the focus of the work in this field is generally on the type of locality information that is provided to the overlay and on the entities that exchange this information. An aspect that is mostly neglected is how this information is used by the peers. In this paper, we consider the predominant approach of Biased Neighbor Selection and compare it with Biased Unchoking, which is an alternative locality aware peer selection strategy that we propose in this paper. We show that both mechanisms complement each other for the BitTorrent file sharing application and achieve the best performance when combined.

Imbuing unstructured P2P systems with non-intrusive topology awareness###The random nature of unstructured P2P overlays imbues them with enhanced self-<sup>*</sup> properties. Most of the algorithms which make searching in unstructured P2P systems scalable, such as dynamic querying and 1-hop replication, rely on the random nature of the overlay to function efficiently. However, they do not take into account the structure of the underlying physical communications network, which is anything but random. Efforts to provide topology awareness to unstructured P2P systems often result to clustered graphs which affect negatively algorithms that rely on random overlays. In this paper, we propose ITA, an algorithm which creates a random overlay of randomly connected neighborhoods providing topology awareness to P2P systems, while at the same time has no negative effect on the self-<sup>*</sup> properties or the operation of the other P2P algorithms. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate that ITA reduces communication latency by as much as 50% which is important for P2P users. Furthermore, it reduces by 20% the number of IP network messages which is critical for ISPs carrying the burden of transporting P2P traffic. Finally, ITA is shown to reduce significantly the load imposed on the routers of the IP network layer.

Exploring the optimal chunk selection policy for data-driven P2P streaming systems###Data-driven P2P streaming systems can potentially provide good playback rate to a large number of viewers. One important design problem in such P2P systems is to determine the optimal chunk selection policy that provides high continuity playback under the server's upload capacity constraint. We present a general and unified mathematical framework to analyze a large class of chunk selection policies. The analytical framework is asymptotically exact when the number of viewers is large. More importantly, we provide some interesting observations on the optimal chunk selection policy: it is of shaped and becomesmore greedy as the upload capacity of the server increases. This insight helps content providers to deploy large scale streaming systems with a QoS-guarantee under a given cost constraint.

Phosphite: Guaranteeing out-of-order download in P2P video on demand###We propose Phosphite, a mechanism to preserve out of order download in peer to peer video-on-demand applications, in the presence of selfish peers. In such applications, peers have a natural trend to download blocks in order to start watching videos as soon as possible. Without specific mechanism to enforce a fair amount of out of order download, the last blocks of the video tend to be lost due to peers leaving soon after having downloaded the last blocks thus forcing peers to rely on the central server for re-introducing those lost blocks. This issue can be solved if peers dedicate a portion of their bandwidth for out of order downloads. Yet, this heavily relies on the goodwill of peers to collaborate. Phosphite is a simple yet efficient approach ensuring that all peers dedicate a part of their bandwidth to out of order download. Phosphite relies on a computational challenge where peers are provided with a combination of the requested blocks and other blocks. This forces peers to download out of order blocks to be able to decode the requested blocks. We evaluate Phosphite and show that it successfully prevents the system from losing blocks, even in the presence of selfish peers, thus offering an appealing alternative to state of the art approaches. With Phosphite, the last blocks remain available (with a probability higher than 0.98), while such result cannot be guaranteed (with a probability lower than 0.5) without enforcement mechanism. Phosphite ensures that a peer to peer download is almost always possible, even in the presence of selfish peers.

Measuring the cost of online load-balancing in distributed range-queriable systems###Distributed systems such as peer-to-peer overlays have been shown to efficiently support the processing of range queries over large numbers of participating hosts. In such systems, uneven load allocation has to be effectively tackled in order to minimize overloaded peers and optimize their performance. In this work, we detect and analyze the two basic methodologies used to achieve load-balancing: Iterative key re-distribution between neighbors and node migration. Based on this analysis, we propose a hybrid method that adaptively utilizes these two extremes to achieve both fast and cost-effective load-balancing in distributed systems that support range queries. As a case study, we offer an implementation on top of a Skip Graph, where we validate our findings in a variety of workloads. Our experimental analysis shows that the hybrid method converges 10% faster than simple neighbor item exchanges and is more than 70% bandwidth efficient compared to simple node migrations.

Why Kad lookup fails###A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is a structured overlay network service that provides a decentralized lookup for mapping objects to locations. In this paper, we study the lookup performance of locating nodes responsible for replicated information in Kad - one of the largest DHT networks existing currently. Throughout the measurement study, we found that Kad lookups locate only 18% of nodes storing replicated data. This failure leads to limited reliability and an inefficient use of resources during lookups. Ironically, we found that this poor performance is due to the high level of routing table similarity, despite the relatively high churn rate in the network. We propose solutions which either exploit the high routing table similarity or avoid the duplicate returns using multiple target keys.

On routing in Distributed Hash Tables: Is reputation a shelter from malicious behavior and churn?###Recently, it has been argued that reputation mechanisms could be used to improve routing by conditioning next-hop decisions to the past behavior of peers. However, churn may severely hinder the applicability of reputations mechanisms. In particular, short peer lifetimes imply that reputations are typically generated from a small number of transactions and are few reliable. To examine how high rates of churn affect reputation systems, we present an analytical model to study the potential damage done by malicious peers together with churn. With our model, we show that it cannot be expected in general that reputations are reliable. We then analyze the impact of this result by proposing a new routing protocol for Chord. Mainly, the protocol exploits reputation to improve the decision about which neighbor select as next-hop peer. Our experimental results show that routing algorithms can obtain important benefits from reputation - even when peer lifetimes are short and the fraction of bad users is moderate.

A flexible Divide-and-Conquer protocol for multi-view peer-to-peer live streaming###Multi-view peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming systems have recently emerged, where a user can simultaneously watch multiple channels. Previous work on multi-view P2P streaming solves the fundamental inter-channel bandwidth competition problem at the individual peer level, and thus can be used with very limited types of streaming protocols. In this paper, we propose a new protocol for multi-view P2P streaming, called divide-and-conquer (DAC), which efficiently solves the inter-channel bandwidth competition problem using a divide-and conquer strategy at the channel level, and thus is flexible to work with various streaming protocols. This makes DAC more suitable for upgrading current single-view P2P live streaming systems to multi-view P2P live streaming systems. Our extensive packetlevel simulations show that DAC is efficient in allocating the overall system bandwidth among competing channels, is flexible in working with various streaming protocols, and is scalable in supporting a large number of users and channels.

Efficient and effective file replication in structured P2P file sharing systems###In peer-to-peer file sharing systems, file replication helps to avoid overloading file owners and improve file query efficiency. Aiming to achieve high replica utilization and efficient file query with low overhead, this paper presents a file replication mechanism based on swarm intelligence, namely SWARM. Recognizing the power of collective behaviors, SWARM identifies node swarms with common node interests and close proximity. It determines the location of a file replica based on the accumulated query rates of nodes in a swarm. Replicas are shared by the nodes in a swarm, leading to less replicas and high query efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the SWARM mechanism in comparison with other file replication methods.

On tracking freeriders in gossip protocols###Peer-to-peer content dissemination applications suffer immensely from freeriders, i.e., nodes that do not provide their fair share. The Tit-for-Tat (TfT) incentives have received much attention as they help make such systems more robust against freeriding. However, these rely on an asymmetric component, namely opportunistic pushes, that let peers receive content without sending anything in return. Opportunistic push constitutes the Achilles' heel of TfT-based protocols as illustrated by the fact that all known attacks against them exploit it. This problem becomes even more serious when used by colluding freeriders. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of using accountability to secure gossip-based dissemination protocols based on asymmetric exchanges. The fact that gossip protocols are dynamic and randomized makes our approach robust against collusion and alleviates the need for cryptography. We present the challenges raised by an auditing approach and give insights into how to build a freerider-tracking protocol for gossip-based content dissemination.

prTorrent: On establishment of piece rarity in the BitTorrent unchoking algorithm###BitTorrent is an extensively adopted p2p Content Distribution System on the Internet. In spite of its pro-incentive approach and ease of implementation, recent research has empirically shown BitTorrent to be vulnerable to strategic manipulation by its constituent peers in a swarm. Moreover, Honest Piece Revelation and Free-Riding is becoming an increasing concern. Our findings indicate that till date, it is the orthogonal treatment of piece rarity and unchoking, that has encouraged strategic manipulation enabling unfair maximization of incentives in p2p systems. In this paper, we propose that solution to such concerns lies in unifying a Piece Rarity factor with the BitTorrent Unchoking Algorithm. We also discuss a new Discount Parameter attack that compromises most Tit-for-Tat mechanisms. Our analysis demonstrates how under-reporting, as a Piece Revelation Strategy in auction based choking algorithms, could result in Starvation. prTorrent, a novel approach based on BitTorrent shows how strategic formulation of the Piece Rarity parameter can optimize incentives in a swarm, and help its constituent peers in achieving the equilibrium facilitating truly co-operative behavior.

GO: Platform support for gossip applications###Gossip-based protocols are increasingly popular in large-scale distributed applications that disseminate updates to replicated or cached content. GO (gossip objects) is a pernode gossip platform that we developed in support of this class of protocols. In addition to making it easy to develop new gossip protocols and applications, GO allows nodes to join multiple gossip groups without losing the appealing fixed bandwidth guarantee of gossip protocols, and the platform optimizes rumor delivery latency in a principled manner. Our heuristic is based on the observations that multiple rumors can often be squeezed into a single IP packet, and that indirect routing of rumors can speed up delivery. We formalize these observations and develop a theoretical analysis of this heuristic. We have also implemented GO, and study the effectiveness of the heuristic by comparing it to the more standard random dissemination gossip strategy via simulation. We also evaluate GO on a trace from a popular distributed application.

Badumna Network Suite: A decentralized network engine for Massively Multiplayer Online applications###We present Badumna Network Suite, a network engine for massively multiplayer online (MMO) applications. MMO applications such as World of Warcraft and Second Life use client-server architecture. This architecture has several drawbacks such as high deployment costs, single point of failure and lack of scalability. Badumna's goal is to scale to truly massive player counts using minimal operator owned infrastructure and network resources. The key to achieving this goal is in forming a peer-to-peer network and distributing the processing on this network. By doing this, Badumna reduces hosting costs significantly and it also increases the maximum number of users that can be allowed in a given region. The technology comprises of a distributed network engine that interfaces with existing MMO platforms. This paper presents the technology and discusses the issues involved in integrating such a technology with commercial gaming platforms - the expectations and the challenges. We then present results from commercial trials and conclude by discussing the role peer-to-peer computing will play in defining the future of MMO technology.

Application management and visualization with Plush###Deploying, running, and maintaining applications running on a distributed set of resources is a challenging task. Software developers often spend a significant amount of time dealing with the complexities associated with software configuration and management in these environments. Distributed application management systems are designed to automate the process, and to ultimately help developers cope with the common problems that arise during the design, implementation, and evaluation of distributed systems. In this talk, we highlight the key features of Plush, an application management system for PlanetLab and ModelNet, and describe how Plush simplifies peer-to-peer system visualization and evaluation.

SimGrid: a generic framework for large-scale distributed experiments###We presented the SimGrid simulation framework whose goal is to provide a generic evaluation tool for large-scale distributed computing. Its main components are: two APIs for researchers who study algorithm and need to prototype simulations quickly, and two for developers who can develop applications in the comfort of the simulated world before deploying them seamlessly in the real world. SimGrid employs a modular simulation kernel that supports the addition and use of new resource models without changes in the user code. We used this feature ourselves to implement several simulation models and even to integrate the GTNetS packet-level simulator.

Towards robust peer counting###This paper describes T-SIZE, a peer counting protocol that is based on gossip-based aggregation. Peer counting has become increasingly important as the size of the network is often a crucial parameter used to guarantee robustness, small diameter, load-balance, or to generally optimize the system. Our work improves the previous work by providing a protocol that is eventually accurate, i.e. the estimate will eventually converge to the true peer count in absence of churn. The protocol can handle extreme levels of churn, and automatically ensures that all participating nodes learn the outcome of the peer counting.

Building distributed systems using Mace###Mace, MaceMC and <i>MacePC</i> work together to make it easier to build correct, high performance distributed systems implementations. Mace developers find that it now takes them a fraction of the time previously needed to go from design to implementation of a new distributed system. Together with ModelNet and Plush, the whole toolkit is among the best in the world for implementing, testing, evaluating, and deploying distributed and peer-to-peer systems. Mace represents six years of development work and has been publicly available for five years. In addition to the Mace research contributions, the Mace distribution also represents many of the best-quality publicly-available implementations of the included services, and by itself represents a practical contribution that users worldwide recognize and utilize.

OverSim: A scalable and flexible overlay framework for simulation and real network applications###A fundamental problem in studying peer-to-peer networks is the evaluation of new protocols. This commonly involves both the simulation of the protocol in a large-scale network as well as the testing of the protocol in connection with real applications in networks like PlanetLab. To facilitate these tasks we have developed the overlay simulation framework OverSim. It is designed to fulfill a number of requirements that have been partially neglected by existing simulation frameworks.
5284504
PlanetSim: An extensible simulation tool for peer-to-peer networks and services###We introduce PlanetSim, a discrete event-based simulation framework for peer-to-peer overlay networks and services. It is implemented in Java and provides good qualities for both researchers and developers, such as a strong system development background, as well as modularity, flexibility and clarity on its design and implementation. All this is corroborated by the important community using and supporting PlanetSim.

PlanetLab - P2P testing in the wild###PlanetLab is a seasoned Internet testbed for distributed applications consisting of donated nodes located at more than 350 remote locations spread across the globe. It is particularly appropriate for peer-to-peer application research due its large-scale, distributed operation, and the availability of nodes with edge characteristics. This talk describes the basic testbed offering and suggests appropriate use-cases.
5284506
PeerSim: A scalable P2P simulator###The key features of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are scalability and dynamism. The evaluation of a P2P protocol in realistic environments is very expensive and difficult to reproduce, so simulation is crucial in P2P research. PeerSim is an extremely scalable simulation environment that supports dynamic scenarios such as churn and other failure models. Protocols need to be specifically implemented for the PeerSim Java API, but with a reasonable effort they can be evolved into a real implementation. Testing in specified parameter-spaces is supported as well. PeerSim started out as a tool for our own research.

Modeling and analysis of bandwidth-inhomogeneous swarms in BitTorrent###A number of analytical models exists that capture various properties of the BitTorrent protocol. However, until now virtually all of these models have been based on the assumption that the peers in the system have homogeneous bandwidths. As this is highly unrealistic in real swarms, these models have very limited applicability. Most of all, these models implicitly ignore BitTorrent's most important property: peer selection based on the highest rate of reciprocity. As a result, these models are not suitable for understanding or predicting the properties of real BitTorrent networks. Furthermore, they are hardly of use in the design of realistic BitTorrent simulators and new P2P protocols. In this paper, we extend existing work by presenting a model of a swarm in BitTorrent where peers have arbitrary upload and download bandwidths. In our model we group peers with (roughly) the same bandwidth in classes, and then analyze the allocation of upload slots from peers in one class to peers in another class. We show that our model accurately predicts the bandwidth clustering phenomenon observed experimentally in other work, and we analyze the resulting data distribution in swarms. We validate our model with experiments using real BitTorrent clients. Our model captures the effects of BitTorrent's well-known `tit-for-tat' mechanism in bandwidth-inhomogeneous swarms and provides an accurate mathematical description of the resulting dynamics.

A trusted infrastructure for P2P-based marketplaces###Peer-to-peer (P2P) based marketplaces have a number of advantages over traditional centralized systems (such as eBay). Peers form a distributed hash table and store sale offers for other peers. A key problem in such a system is ensuring that the peers store and report all sale offers fairly, and do not for instance favor their own offers. We give a solution to this problem based on trusted computing, but unlike other approaches we do not measure and restrict all firmware and software running on a peer. Instead, we tie offers to monotonic counters in such a way that any attempt to not report an offer, or report it falsely, will be detected.
5284521
The impact of NAT on BitTorrent-like P2P systems###BitTorrent nowadays is one of the most popular peer-to-peer (P2P) applications on the Internet; on the other hand, network address translation (NAT) has become pervasive in almost all networking scenarios. Despite the effort of NAT traversal, it is still very likely that P2P applications cannot receive incoming connection requests properly if they are behind NAT. Although this phenomenon has been widely observed, so far there is no quantitative study in the literature examining the impact of NAT on P2P applications. In this paper, we build analytical models to capture the performance of BitTorrent-like P2P systems with the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous NAT peers. We further propose biased optimistic unchoke strategies in order to improve the overall system performance considerably. The analytical models have been validated by simulation results, which also reveal some interesting facts about the coexistence of NAT and public peers in P2P systems.

SyMon: Defending large structured P2P systems against Sybil attack###Sybil attack is one of the most challenging problems that plague current decentralized peer-to-peer systems. In Sybil attack, a single malicious user creates multiple peer identities known as sybils. These sybils are employed to target honest peers and hence subvert the system. In this paper, we propose a novel solution that enables all honest peers to protect themselves from sybils with high probability in large structured P2P systems. In our proposed sybil defense system, we associate every peer with another non-sybil peer known as SyMon. A given peer's SyMon is chosen dynamically such that the chances of both of them being sybils are very low. The chosen SyMon is entrusted with the responsibility of moderating the transactions involving the given peer and hence makes it almost impossible for sybils to compromise the system. We show the effectiveness of our proposed system in defending against Sybil attack both analytically and experimentally.

Virtual Direction Routing for overlay networks###The enormous interest for peer-to-peer systems in recent years has prompted research into finding scalable and robust seeding and searching methods to support these overlay networks. Routing and search in these overlay networks have ranged from flooding-based unstructured techniques to structured ones mainly for popular and rate items respectively. In this paper, we propose a new method of establishing a virtual structure and introduce a technique to scalably route packets through an unstructured overlay network. We introduce virtual direction routing (VDR). VDR is a lightweight and scalable overlay network routing protocol that uses the concept of virtual directions to efficiently perform node information seeding and lookup. State information is replicated at nodes along virtual orthogonal lines originating from each node and periodically updated. When a path lookup is initiated, instead of flooding the network, query packets are also forwarded along virtual orthogonal lines until an intersection with the seeded state occurs. We show that VDR achieves high reachability with relatively low seed and search packet TTL even under high network churn. We also show that VDR scales well without imposing DHT-like graph structures (e.g., trees, rings, torus, coordinate-space) and the path stretch compared to random-walk protocols is very good. The tradeoff is added latency by choosing suboptimal paths.

Embedding network coordinates into the heart of distributed hash tables###Network coordinates (NCs) construct a logical space which enables efficient and accurate estimation of network latency. Although many researchers have proposed NC-based strategies to reduce the lookup latency of distributed hash tables (DHTs), these strategies are limited in the improvement of the lookup latency; the nearest node to which a query should be forwarded is not always included in the consideration scope of a node. This is because conventional DHTs assign node IDs independent of the underlying physical network. In this paper, we propose an NC-based method of constructing a topology-aware DHT by Proximity Identifier Selection strategy (PIS/NC). PIS/NC assigns an ID to each node based on NC of the node. This paper presents Canary, a PIS/NC-based CAN whose d-dimensional logical space corresponds to that of Vivaldi. Our simulation results suggest that PIS/NC has the possibility of dramatically improving the lookup latency of DHTs. Whereas DHash++ is only able to reduce the median lookup latency by 15% of the original Chord, Canary reduces it by 70% of the original CAN.

A local distributed peer-to-peer algorithm using multi-party optimization based privacy preservation for data mining primitive computation###This paper proposes a scalable, local privacy-preserving algorithm for distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) data aggregation useful for many advanced data mining/analysis tasks such as average/sum computation, decision tree induction, feature selection, and more. Unlike most multi-party privacy-preserving data mining algorithms, this approach works in an asynchronous manner through local interactions and therefore, is highly scalable. It particularly deals with the distributed computation of the sum of a set of numbers stored at different peers in a P2P network in the context of a P2P Web mining application. The proposed optimization-based privacy-preserving technique for computing the sum allows different peers to specify different privacy requirements without having to adhere to a global set of parameters for the chosen privacy model. Since distributed sum computation is a frequently used primitive, the proposed approach is likely to have significant impact on many data mining tasks such as multi-party privacy-preserving clustering, frequent itemset mining, and statistical aggregate computation.

An approximation algorithm for minimum-delay peer-to-peer streaming###Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology provides a scalable solution in multimedia streaming. Many streaming applications, such as IPTV and video conferencing, have rigorous constraints on end-to-end delays. Obtaining assurances on meeting those delay constraints in dynamic and heterogenous network environments is a challenge. In this paper, we devise a streaming scheme which minimizes the maximum end-to-end streaming delay for a mesh-based overlay network paradigm. We first formulate the minimum-delay P2P streaming problem, called the MDPS problem, and prove its NP-completeness. We then present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to this problem, and show that the performance of our algorithm is bounded by a ratio of O. Our simulation study reveals the effectiveness of our algorithm, and shows a reasonable message overhead.

Monitoring and management of structured peer-to-peer systems###The peer-to-peer paradigm shows the potential to provide the same functionality and quality like client/server based systems, but with much lower costs. In order to control the quality of peer-to-peer systems, monitoring and management mechanisms need to be applied. Both tasks are challenging in large-scale networks with autonomous, unreliable nodes. In this paper we present a monitoring and management framework for structured peer-to-peer systems. It captures the live status of a peer-to-peer network in an exhaustive statistical representation. Using principles of autonomic computing, a preset system state is approached through automated system re-configuration in the case that a quality deviation is detected. Evaluation shows that the monitoring is very precise and lightweight and that preset quality goals are reached and kept automatically.

ProtoPeer: Distributed systems prototyping toolkit###In ProtoPeer, the developer can switch between the simulation of a P2P system to its deployment on the actual network without changing a single line of code. This dramatically speeds up the implement-evaluate-reimplement cycle and allows for rapid system prototyping. Most of the major bugs and performance problems are caught early on during the simulation while the more time-consuming live deployment is used for the accurate evaluation of the final system.

SODA: Towards a framework for self optimization via demand adaptation in Peer-to-Peer networks###Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have been consuming an increasingly significant fraction of Internet bandwidth. They are becoming a financial burden to Internet service providers (ISPs), creating hot spots in the Internet, and causing potential performance degradation to other applications. As a result, there has been increasing tensions between P2P applications and network service providers. In this paper, we propose a framework called SODA for P2P applications to be self-adaptive and optimize their demands in order to more efficiently utilize network resources. Through preliminary experiments using two representative P2P applications, we demonstrate that SODA can effectively reduce bandwidth consumption by adapting the demands among peers.
5284511
Traffic localization for P2P-applications: The ALTO approach###Today, most P2P applications do not consider locality on the underlying network topology when choosing their neighbors on the P2P routing layer. As a result, participating peers may experience long delays and peers' ISPs suffer from a large amount of (costly) inter-ISP traffic. One potential solution to mitigate these problems is to have ISPs or third parties convey information regarding the underlying network topology to P2P-clients through a dedicated service. Following this approach, the IETF has recently formed an application layer traffic optimization (ALTO) working group for standardizing a protocol to enable P2P applications to obtain information regarding network layer topology. This paper comprises the problem space for such an ALTO approach, taking into account recent developments in the IETF ALTO Working Group. In particular, we will describe requirements for an ALTO protocol identified in the IETF, concrete protocols which have been proposed so far, and the overall challenges. In addition, we will discuss related issues such as privacy considerations, the relationship of an ALTO service with existing caching solutions, discovery mechanisms for an ALTO service, and security considerations.

Optimizing capacity-heterogeneous unstructured P2P networks for random-walk traffic###Existing algorithms for utilizing high-capacity nodes in heterogeneous P2P systems (e.g.) often require unrealistically large node degree and high maintenance overhead in P2P networks with highly diverse node capacities and high churn. In this paper, we propose an unstructured P2P system that addresses these issues. We first prove that the overall throughput of search queries in a heterogeneous network is maximized if and only if traffic load through each node is proportional to its capacity. We then propose a system that achieves this traffic distribution by biasing search walks using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm without requiring any special underlying topology. We finish the paper by comparing our method with Gia, where we find in simulation that the former outperforms the latter under all studied conditions, two novel saturation metrics introduced in this paper, and such end-to-end parameters as query success rate, latency, and query-hits.
5284553
Gossip-based topology inference for efficient overlay mapping on data centers###We present a distributed algorithm for identifying the location of data centers and their relative sizes. This topology information can be used in P2P systems to improve the routing performance, replica placement, or job scheduling. The algorithm uses gossiping with local agglomerative clustering. It is robust to failures and it correctly identifies outliers that are caused, e.g., by temporarily overloaded nodes or network failures. We present empirical results on the Grid 5000 testbed.

Robust lifetime measurement in large-scale P2P systems with non-stationary arrivals###Characterizing user churn has become an important topic in studying P2P networks, both in theoretical analysis and system design. Recent work has shown that direct sampling of user lifetimes may lead to certain bias (arising from missed peers and round-off inconsistencies) and proposed a technique that estimates lifetimes based on sampled residuals. In this paper, however, we show that under non-stationary arrivals, which are often present in real systems, residual-based sampling does not correctly reconstruct user lifetimes and suffers a varying degree of bias, which in some cases makes estimation completely impossible. We overcome this problem using two contributions: a novel non-stationary ON/OFF churn model and an unbiased randomized residual sampling technique for measuring user lifetimes. The former allows correlation between ON/OFF periods of the same user and exhibits different join rates during the day. The latter spreads sampling points uniformly during the day and uses a novel estimator to reconstruct the underlying lifetime distribution. We finish the paper with experimental measurements of Gnutella and discussing reduction in overhead compared to direct sampling methods.

ID repetition in Kad###ID uniqueness is essential in DHT-based systems as peer lookup and resource searching rely on ID-matching. Many previous works and measurements on Kad do not take into account that IDs among peers may not be unique. We observe that a significant portion of peers, 19.5% of the peers in routing tables and 4.5% of the active peers (those who respond to Kad protocol), do not have unique IDs. These repetitions would mislead the measurements of Kad network. We further observe that there are a large number of peers that frequently change their UDP ports, and there are a few IDs that repeat for a large number of times and all peers with these IDs do not respond to Kad protocol. We analyze the effects of ID repetitions under simplified settings and find that ID repetition degrades Kad's performance on publishing and searching, but has insignificant effect on lookup process. These measurement and analysis are useful in determining the sources of repetitions and are also useful in finding suitable parameters for publishing and searching.
5284518
Analysis of failure correlation impact on peer-to-peer storage systems###Peer-to-peer storage systems aim to provide a reliable long-term storage at low cost. In such systems, peers fail continuously, hence, the necessity of self-repairing mechanisms to achieve high durability. In this paper, we propose and study analytical models that assess the bandwidth consumption and the probability to lose data of storage systems that use erasure coded redundancy. We show by simulations that the classical stochastic approach found in the literature, that models each block independently, gives a correct approximation of the system average behavior, but fails to capture its variations over time. These variations are caused by the simultaneous loss of multiple data blocks that results from a peer failing (or leaving the system). We then propose a new stochastic model based on a fluid approximation that better captures the system behavior. In addition to its expectation, it gives a correct estimation of its standard deviation. This new model is validated by simulations.

Long-term digital archiving based on selection of repositories over P2P networks###The importance of digital information is constantly increasing in the last years. Such information often needs to be preserved for a long-term and this is the responsibility of digital archiving systems. This paper proposes a reliable replication model of immutable digital content to be used in long-term archiving systems. The archiving system is modeled as a set of storage repositories where each repository has an independent fail probability assigned to it. Items are inserted with a reliability that is satisfied by replicating them in subsets of repositories. Through simulation, we evaluated three different proposed strategies to create replicas. It is also proposed a completely distributed archiving system using this model over a structured peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The communication between the nodes (repositories) of the network is organized in a distributed hash table and multiple hash functions are used to select repositories that will keep the replicas of each stored item. The system is evaluated through experiments in a real environment. The proposed model and the algorithms, combined with the structured P2P scalability made possible the construction of a reliable and totally distributed digital archiving system.

A scalable interest-oriented peer-to-peer pub/sub network###Publish/subscribe represents a new paradigm for distributed content delivery. It provides an alternative to address-based communication due to its ability to decouple communication between the source and the destination. However, it has remained a challenge to devise a scalable overlay supporting expressive content-filtering while satisfying the desirable requirements large distributed systems should fulfill. Our goal is to build an efficient P2P publish/subscribe network where only interested nodes are involved in event dissemination, and the amount of overhead generated by network discovery and membership management is small. In order to do so, we use a Bloom filter based mapping scheme to map IDs to nodes' interests, in addition to a new interest proximity metric to forward events and to build nodes' routing tables. As for network discovery we propose a new approach we call ldquoshared interest approachrdquo. Our scheme ensures an upper bound of routing tables size that only depends on the size of the ID digest. To evaluate the algorithms proposed in this work we conducted simulations in both static and dynamic settings.

QPM: Phonetic aware P2P search###Efficient discovery of information based on partially specified and misspelled query keywords is a challenging problem in large scale peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. This paper presents QPM, a P2P search mechanism for efficient information retrieval with misspelled and partial keywords. QPM uses the double metaphone algorithm to phonetically match misspelled query keywords with advertised keywords. For achieving bandwidth efficiency and similarity matching, QPM incorporates second order Reed-Muller code within the Plexus protocol having a logarithmic routing efficiency on overlay network size. QPM supports large scale networks and achieves better resilience to peer failure by maintaining redundant routing paths and by systematically placing index replicas. The concept presented in this paper is supported by necessary experimental evaluation.

Connectivity properties of Mainline BitTorrent DHT nodes###The birth and evolution of peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols have, for the most part, been about peer discovery. Napster, one of the first P2P protocols, was basically FTP/HTTP plus a way of finding hosts willing to send you the file. Since then, both the transfer and peer discovery mechanisms have improved, but only recently have we seen a real push to completely decentralized peer discovery to increase scalability and resilience. Most such efforts are based on distributed hash tables (DHTs), with Kademlia being a popular choice of DHT implementation. While sound in theory, and performing well in simulators and testbeds, the real-world performance often falls short of expectations. Our hypothesis is that the connectivity artifacts caused by guarded hosts (i.e., hosts behind firewalls and NATs) are the major cause for such poor performance. In this paper, the first steps towards testing this hypothesis are developed. First, we present a taxonomy of connectivity properties which will become the language used to accurately describe connectivity artifacts. Second, based on experiments "in the wild", we analyze the connectivity properties of over 3 million hosts. Finally, we match those properties to guarded host behavior and identify the potential effects on the DHT.

Sorcery: Could we make P2P content sharing systems robust to deceivers?###Deceptive behaviors of peers in peer-to-peer (P2P) content sharing systems have become a serious problem due to the features of P2P overlay networks such as anonymity, self-organization, etc. This paper presents Sorcery, a novel active challenge-response mechanism based on the notion that one side of interaction with dominant information can detect whether the other side is telling a lie. To make each client obtain the dominant information, our approach introduces social network to the P2P content sharing system; thus, the client can establish friend-relationships with peers who are either acquaintances in reality or those reliable online friends. Using the confidential voting histories of friends as own dominant information, the client can challenge the content providers with the overlapping votes of both his friends and the content provider, thus detecting whether the content provider is a deceiver. Moreover, Sorcery provides the punishment mechanism which can reduce the impact brought by deceptive behaviors, and our work also discusses some key practical issues. The experimental results illustrate that Sorcery can effectively address the problem of deceptive behaviors, and work better than the existing reputation models.

Building and evaluating P2P systems using the Kompics component framework###We present a framework for building and evaluating P2P systems in simulation, local execution, and distributed deployment. Such uniform system evaluations increase confidence in the obtained results. We briefly introduce the Kompics component model and its P2P framework. We describe the component architecture of a Kompics P2P system and show how to define experiment scenarios for large dynamic systems. The same experiments are conducted in reproducible simulation, in real-time execution on a single machine, and distributed over a local cluster or a wide area network. This demonstration shows the component oriented design and the evaluation of two P2P systems implemented in Kompics: Chord and Cyclon. We simulate the systems and then we execute them in realtime. During realtime execution we monitor the dynamic behavior of the systems and interact with them through their Web-based interfaces. We demonstrate how component-oriented design enables seamless switching between alternative protocols.

An efficient distributed PKI for structured P2P networks###In decentralized P2P networks, many security mechanisms still rely on a central authority. This centralization creates a single point of failure and does not comply with the P2P principles. We previously proposed a distributed PKI for P2P networks which allows to push security mechanisms to the edges of the network but relies on unaffordable maintenance operations using byzantine agreements. In this paper, we address this shortcoming and propose efficient maintenance operations without any agreements. Our improvements allow a real deployment of this P2P PKI.

Sherlock: A framework for P2P traffic analyis###After P2P file-sharing and VoIP telephony applications, VoD and live-streaming P2P applications have finally gained a large Internet audience as well. In this work, we define a framework for the comparison of these applications, based on the measurement and analysis of the traffic they generate. In order for the framework to be descriptive for all P2P applications, we first define the observable of interest: such metrics either pertain to different layers of the protocol stack (from network up to the application), or convey cross-layer information (such as the degree of awareness, at overlay layer, of properties characterizing the underlying physical network). The framework is compact (as it allows to represent all the above information at once), general (as is can be extended to consider metrics different from the one reported in this work), and flexible in both space and time (as it allows different levels of spatial aggregation, and also to represent the temporal evolution of the quantities of interest). Based on this framework, we analyze some of the most popular P2P application nowadays, highlighting their main similarities and differences.

ModelNet: Towards a datacenter emulation environment###ModelNet is a network emulator designed for repeatable, large-scale experimentation with real networked systems. This talk introduces the ideas behind ModelNet that have made it a successful experimental platform. Beyond these core concepts, the talk highlights the latest additions to our methodology to test the next generation of network protocols and applications. Many of these developments address the datacenter compute environment: high-capacity networks, sophisticated infrastructure software (storage and virtualization), and complex network load. While these efforts significantly extend ModelNet's capabilities, there remain a number of open challenges, including incorporating new performance objectives (energy) and multicore architectures.

Peer-to-Peer Traffic in Operator Networks###This paper examines the issues encountered by network operators when content providers utilize peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies to distribute media. After outlining the various causes of the conflict a set of potential solutions are presented.

Cross-Layer Aspects of Peer-to-Peer Overlays on IP Platforms of Network Providers###Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have introduced a distributed communication paradigm, which is useful for many communication services and still accounts for a considerable fraction of the Internet traffic. We discuss the efficiency of P2P content distribution as compared to alternative content delivery overlays.

Piki - A Peer-to-Peer based Wiki Engine###In this paper, Wiki technology proved to be an appropriate tool for sharing global knowledge, as it provides an easy way to contribute and consume information. The way wikis are used, e.g. consuming and contributing information, naturally matches the peer-to-peer (p2p) paradigm, which inherently follows the structure of its distributed users. Compared to client-server solutions, it has significantly lower maintenance costs, no bottleneck or single point of failure, and resources are used and offered by all users. We propose a purely p2p based wiki engine (PIKI) with the focus on concurrent editing, version control, and decentralized full-text search (in a structured overlay). Further we elaborate tracking semantic information between linked articles through different versions, where a typed link itself holds meta-data about the linked files.

Towards P2P Technologies for the Control of Electrical Power Systems###Peer-to-peer technology has the potential to achieve scalability, fault-tolerance and robustness in a cost-efficient way. These properties are not only of interest for Internet applications, but benefits can also be realized in industrial applications. In this short article we discuss the use of P2P networks for the control of microgrids, small islanded parts in electrical power systems. Although deployment of P2P seems far from now, the importance of open networks for the control and supervision of critical infrastructure will increase.

Playing with the Bandwidth Conservation Law###We investigate performance bounds of P2P systems by application of the law of bandwidth conservation. This approach is quite general and allows us to consider various sharing systems such as fixed-rate streaming, VoD-type streaming, and elastic file sharing. Starting from a general law of bandwidth conservation, we consider several specific cases that apply to various P2P systems. For dynamic systems with a stationary arrival process, we show that simple seeding policies result in regimes where the download rates are arbitrarily fast. We consider a case with equal download rate among all peers as well as cases where the download rate is a function of upload rates, inspired by BitTorrent's tit-for-tat policy. In particular, we show that the sustainable proportion of free-riders is closely related to the tit-for-tat parameter.

A P2P-Based Architecture for Secure Software Delivery Using Volunteer Assistance###We present a content delivery infrastructure distributing and maintaining software packages in a large organization. Our work is based on a trace-based analysis of an existing software delivery system that we conducted to find general principles and properties could be used to devise a better solution. Our design combines a conventional server with volunteer nodes that expand its scalability. We rely on Peer-to-Peer technology to speed up content synchronization among the volunteer nodes while maintaining a conventional client/server interface for the service customers. Finally our system includes a novel load balancing mechanism that considers both the synchronization workload and the customer-generated workload of the volunteer nodes. Our simulation results indicate that the feedback information currently available at the server/tracker of the P2P system offers enough information to ensure a fair load distribution among the peers.

Ad Hoc Limited Scale-Free Models for Unstructured Peer-to-Peer Networks###Several protocol efficiency metrics (e.g., scalability, search success rate, routing reachability and stability) depend on the capability of preserving structure even over the churn caused by the ad hoc nodes joining or leaving the network. Preserving the structure becomes more prohibitive due to the distributed and potentially uncooperative nature of such networks, as in the peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Thus, most practical solutions involve unstructured approaches while attempting to maintain the structure at various levels of protocol stack. The primary focus of this paper is to investigate construction and maintenance of scale-free topologies in a distributed manner without requiring global topology information at the time when nodes join or leave. We consider the uncooperative behavior of peers by limiting the number of neighbors to a pre-defined hard cutoff value (i.e., no peer is a major hub), and the ad hoc behavior of peers by rewiring the neighbors of nodes leaving the network. We also investigate the effect of these hard cutoffs and rewiring of ad-hoc nodes on the P2P search efficiency.

Proactive Role Discovery in Mediator-Free Environments###The rapid proliferation of Internet and related technologies has created tremendous possibilities for the interoperability between domains in distributed environments. Interoperability does not come easy at it opens the way for several security and privacy breaches. In this paper, we focus on the distributed authorization discovery problem that is crucial to enable secure interoperability. We present a distributed access path discovery framework that does not require a centralized mediator. We propose and verify a role routing protocol that propagates secure, minimal-length paths to reachable roles in other domains. Finally, we present experimental results of our role routing protocol based on a simulation implementation.

Failure-Tolerant Overlay Trees for Large-Scale Dynamic Networks###Trees are fundamental structures for data dissemination in large-scale network scenarios. However, their inherent fragility has led researchers to rely on more redundant mesh topologies in the presence of churn or other highly dynamic settings. In this paper, instead, we outline a novel protocol that directly and efficiently maintains a tree overlay in the presence of churn. It simultaneously achieves other beneficial properties such as limiting the maximum node degree, minimizing the extent of the tree topology changes resulting from failures, and limiting the number of nodes affected by each topology change. Applicability to a range of distributed applications is discussed and results are evaluated through extensive simulation and a PlanetLab deployment.

Peer-to-Peer Secure Multi-party Numerical Computation###We propose an efficient framework for enabling secure multi-party numerical computations in a Peer-to-Peer network. This problem arises in a range of applications such as collaborative filtering, distributed computation of trust and reputation, monitoring and numerous other tasks, where the computing nodes would like to preserve the privacy of their inputs while performing a joint computation of a certain function. Although there is a rich literature in the field of distributed systems security concerning secure multi-party computation, in practice it is hard to deploy those methods in very large scale Peer-to-Peer networks. In this work, we examine several possible approaches and discuss their feasibility. Among the possible approaches, we identify a single approach which is both scalable and theoretically secure. An additional novel contribution is that we show how to compute the neighborhood based collaborative filtering, a state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithm, winner of the Netflix progress prize of the year 2007. Our solution computes this algorithm in a Peer-to-Peer network, using a privacy preserving computation, without loss of accuracy. Using extensive large scale simulations on top of real Internet topologies, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach. As far as we know, we are the first to implement such a large scale secure multi-party simulation of networks of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges.

On the Feasibility of Dynamic Superpeer Ratio Maintenance###The notion of "superpeer" has been shown to be very effective to increase the scalability of P2P applications. For superpeer systems to work, it is critical to preserve the optimal ratio between the number of superpeers and normal peers participating in the overlay. This requires that peers change dynamically their role (i.e., from su-perpeer to normal peer and vice versa) in the presence of node arrivals and departures, a problem that is hard to solve if no peer has global knowledge of the network. In this article, we first investigate the feasibility of superpeer ratio maintenance when each peer can decide to be a superpeer independently of each other. We then show how this problem can be treated as an optimization problem, and we propose a distributed algorithm, based on particle swarm optimization (PSO), to solve it. Our simulation results prove the viability of a PSO-based approach for this problem.

On Server Dimensioning for Hybrid P2P Content Distribution Networks###One of the key questions in dimensioning a hybrid P2P content distribution system is that of the required infrastructure support in terms of server bandwidth. In this paper, we develop and propose simple mathematical models for analyzing and dimensioning hybrid peer-to-peer content distribution networks. We first use a deterministic fluid model to capture the essential peer and server dynamics within a single swarm, and subsequently derive a stochastic fluid model to capture the dynamics in the case of multiple swarms, i.e., concurrent swarms of a number of content objects. Based on the models, we derive solutions for estimating the server capacity required to support a single swarm as well as a number of concurrent file swarms at a given level of service quality. Numerical results demonstrate how a hybrid P2P approach can yield substantial performance gains and capacity savings compared to a pure client/server system, with churn rate and upload bandwidth being critical factors. Compared to a pure peer-to-peer scenario, the hybrid approach can dramatically boost the performance and improve reliability.

P2P Experimentations with Splay: From Idea to Deployment Results in 30 min.###Splay is an integrated system that facilitates the complete chain of distributed systems evaluation, from design and implementation to deployment and experiments control. Algorithms are expressed in a concise, yet very efficient, language based on Lua. Implementations in Splay are highly similar to the pseudo-code usually found in research papers. Splay eases the use of any kind of testbeds, e.g., PlanetLab, ModelNet clusters, or non-dedicated platforms such as networks of workstations. Using Splay and PlanetLab, this demonstration highlights a complete evaluation chain of an epidemic protocol and a churn-driven experiment using the Pastry DHT.

LiveShift: Peer-to-Peer Live Streaming with Distributed Time-Shifting###The increasing assortment of devices with IP connectivity contributes to the high popularity of video sharing over the Internet. High traffic generated by such applications at the source can be better distributed using a peer-to-peer overlay, since every user forwards information to other users. Current implementations target either live or on demand video streaming. LiveShift is an application that combines both approaches. While video is transmitted through the peer-to-peer network in a live fashion, all peers participate in a distributed storage. This adds ability to replay time-shifted streams from other peers in a distributed and scalable manner. For the demonstration, a decentralized network is used, with peers running on EMANICSLab nodes and notebook computers.

Is There a Future for Mesh-Based live Video Streaming?###Peer-to-peer live streaming systems allow a bandwidth-constrained source to broadcast a video feed to a large number of users. In addition, a design with high link utilization can achieve high stream rates, supporting high-quality video. Until now, only tree-based designs have been shown to achieve close-to-optimal rates in real-life conditions, leaving the question open as to the attainable efficiency of completely unstructured mesh-based approaches. In this paper we answer that question by showing that a carefully-designed mesh-based system can achieve close-to-optimal stream rates. Specifically, we implement and evaluate a design based on a mesh-based algorithm called DP/LU. Contrary to tree-based designs, DP/LU uses an unstructured overlay, which is easier to construct and is highly resistant to churn. In addition, we introduce mechanisms for overlay rewiring and source scheduling that lead to significant performance improvements. Our experimental evaluation shows that our design achieves 95% of the maximum achievable stream rate in a static environment, and 90% under high churn. This demonstrates that mesh-based designs are an excellent choice for scalable and robust high-quality peer-to-peer live streaming.

CliqueStream: An Efficient and Fault-Resilient Live Streaming Network on a Clustered Peer-to-Peer Overlay###Several overlay-based live multimedia streaming platforms have been proposed in the recent peer-to-peer streaming literature. In most of the cases, the overlay neighbors are chosen randomly for robustness of the overlay. However, this causes nodes that are distant in terms of proximity in the underlying physical network to become neighbors, and thus data travels unnecessary distances before reaching the destination. For efficiency of bulk data transmission like multimedia streaming, the overlay neighborhood should resemble the proximity in the underlying network. In this paper, we exploit the proximity and redundancy properties of a recently proposed clique-based clustered overlay network, named eQuus, to build efficient as well as robust overlays for multimedia stream dissemination. To combine the efficiency of content pushing over tree structured overlays and the robustness of data-driven mesh overlays, higher capacity stable nodes are organized in tree structure to carry the long haul traffic and less stable nodes with intermittent presence are organized in localized meshes. The overlay construction and fault-recovery procedures are explained in details. Simulation study demonstrates the good locality properties of the platform. The outage time and control overhead induced by the failure recovery mechanism are minimal as demonstrated by the analysis.

Query Workload Driven Summarization for P2P Query Routing###Query routing in peer-to-peer systems is based onthe peers' content summaries. For the sake of scalability, summaries are built at a "peer level." The coarseness of peer level summaries limits their ability to route queries accurately to peers sharing relevant contents. We propose to improve the quality of each peer's summary by grouping its contents and summarizing each group individually. To enhance grouping effectiveness, we incorporate information about real-world term distributions into group generation. Experimental results show that our techniques significantly improve query routing accuracy with little cost.

A Bandwidth-Aware Scheduling Strategy for P2P-TV Systems###P2P-TV systems distribute live streaming contents by organizing the information flow in small chunks that are exchanged among peers. Different strategies can be implemented at the peers to select the chunk to distribute and the destination neighboring peer. Recent work showed that a good strategy consists in selecting the latest received chunk and a random neighboring peer (latest useful chunk, random peer). In this paper, leveraging on the idea that it is convenient to favor those peers that can contribute the most to the chunk distribution, we propose to select the destination peer with a probability proportional to the peer upload bandwidth. We show that the proposed scheme has a limited sensitivity to cheating peers that maliciously declare higher bandwidth than they actually have. Considering the overlay topology, we evaluate both systems in which nodes have fixed degree and systems whose overlay setup takes into account the actual peer bandwidth by assigning more neighbors to peer with higher bandwidth. We evaluate the performance in terms of delay percentiles and loss probability and evaluate the achieved improvements. Simulation results considering scenarios with up to 10,000 peers shows that the proposed schemes significantly outperform the traditional ones, so that the chunk distribution delay drops to less than 2 s from about 12 s.
4627253
Transaction Rate Limiters for Peer-to-Peer Systems###We introduce transaction rate limiters, new mechanisms that limit (probabilistically) the maximum number of transactions a user of a peer-to-peer system can do in any given period. They can be used to limit the consumption of selfish users and the damage done by malicious users. They complement reputation systems, solving the traitor problem. We give simple distributed algorithms that work over time frames as short as seconds and are very robust: they use no trusted servers and continue to work even when attacked by a large fraction of users colluding. Our algorithms are based on a new primitive we have devised, probably-anonymous queries, which guarantees anonymity with a specified probability.
4627257
AREX: An Adaptive System for Secure Resource Access in Mobile P2P Systems###In open environments, such as mobile peer-to-peer systems, participants may need to access resources from unknown users. A critical security concern in such systems is the access of faulty resources, thereby wasting the requester's time and energy and possibly causing damage to her system. A common approach to mitigating the problem involves reputation mechanisms; however, since reputation relies on cooperation, a reputation mechanism's effectiveness can be significantly diminished in hostile environments. Reputation systems also require substantial communication among peers leading to: i) vulnerability to errors caused by intermittent connectivity; ii) message delivery disruptions caused by malicious peers; and iii) energy sapping message overheads. In this paper, we present AREX, a low-cost, adaptive mechanism designed to provide security for peers in hostile and uncertain environments, which are common in mobile P2P systems. AREX features an adaptive exploration strategy that increases the system's utility for benign peers and decreases the systempsilas utility for malicious peers. AREX reduces vulnerabilities and energy costs by operating without communication between peers. Through simulation, we demonstrate AREX's ability to reduce energy costs, protect benign peers, and diminish malicious peers' motivation to attack in a variety of hostile environments.

Tempering Kademlia with a Robust Identity Based System###The lack of a trusted authority, responsible for peers' identity verification or for authentication purposes, makes actual P2P systems extremely vulnerable to a large spectrum of attacks. The main purpose of this paper is to present Likir (layered identity-based Kademlia-like infrastructure), a framework that includes an identity-based scheme and a secure communication protocol, built on top of Kademlia, that may provide an effective defense against well known attacks. This will be accomplished with the adoption of a certification service, with the use of an authentication protocol between nodes and with the introduction of credentials to make non-repudiable the ownership of the contents and messages inserted in the DHT. For sake of interoperability with other social networking services, Likir enables identity management under the Identity 2.0 framework. Under this perspective, the IBS (identity-based signature) scheme is taken into consideration and analyzed as well.

Securing Peer-to-Peer Content Sharing Service from Poisoning Attacks###Poisoning attacks in the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) content sharing service have become a serious security problem on the global Internet due to the features of P2P systems such as self-organization, self-maintenance, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel poisoning-resistant security framework based on the notion that the content providers would be the only trusted sources to verify the integrity of the requested content. To provide the mechanisms of availability and scalability, a content provider publishes the information of his shared contents to a group of content maintainers self-organized in a security overlay, so that a content requestor can verify the integrity of the requested content from the associated content maintainers. Two defense functions are first carried out - filtering out malicious activities and selecting the authentic content version. Then, the content requestor can perform the content integrity verification while downloading and take prompt protection actions to handle content poisoning attacks. To further enhance the system performance, we devise a scalable probabilistic verification scheme. The evaluation results illustrate that our framework can effectively and efficiently defend against content poisoning in various scenarios.

Incentives Against Hidden Action in QoS Overlays###Peer-to-peer networks providing QoS-enabled services are sensitive to hidden action situations, where the actions of a server peer are hidden from the peers who receive services from it. This is because server peers can choose to strategically minimize their effort, and client peers may be unable to distinguish between cases where the server exerted insufficient effort and cases where the server kept its advertised effort levels but the end-to-end conditions in the network were sufficiently adverse. We propose a principal-agent model for hidden action that gives server peers sufficient incentives to meet their advertised effort levels, without client peers having to decide for each transaction whether the outcome was due to server behavior or network conditions. This allows peers to draft contracts that provide incentives for truthful revelation of QoS capabilities, and to have predictable transaction quality. We then exemplify the model for the case of a mesh-based, pull-oriented streaming system with low delay requirements. For this case, we show how to estimate the model parameters a function of the prevailing network conditions, and how to enforce contract fulfillment through a reciprocative strategy.

Embracing the Peer Next Door: Proximity in Kademlia###At present, the probability of selecting "the peer next door" as an overlay neighbour in Kademlia is fairly small. Prior research has been concerned with reducing the lookup latency by means of proximity neighbour and route selection, but focused on recursive routing algorithms. This work leverages location data about peers and extends Kademlia's iterative routing algorithm to reduce cross-network traffic at the level of the distributed hash table. Evaluation with real-world measurement data gives evidence that locality of traffic tends to reduce lookup latencies as well. In turn, mechanisms that aim at reducing lookup latencies do not necessarily reduce cross-network traffic to the same extent.

On the Trade-Off between Efficiency and Congestion in Location-Aware Overlay Networks - Example of a Vertical Handover Support System###Introducing location-awareness in overlay networks allows for a higher efficiency of the offered services, e.g., shorter search times or higher throughput. This is especially important for business applications supported by overlays. In this paper, we will illustrate how such an increase in efficiency causes congestion in an otherwise well-dimensioned locality-aware overlay using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). In particular, we will use a Vertical Handover (VHO) support system using a Pastry substrate as an example. We will describe the occuring congestion problem and identify the underlying reasons. Thus, we describe the basic trade-off between efficiency and load-inequality. Furthermore, we introduce a solution for the specific issue observed, and conduct a performance evaluation identifying the major influence factors and optimization potential for future work.

pSense - Maintaining a Dynamic Localized Peer-to-Peer Structure for Position Based Multicast in Games###This paper presents an algorithm for creating and maintaining a dynamic localized peer-to-peer overlay network with its main application to massively multiplayer games. In these games, players reside in a large game world with many thousands of players but each player has typically a limited vision range. In our solution, players join the network as peers and mainly connect to neighbor peers that are close to them in the virtual game world. As players move in the game they change their neighbors dynamically with very little overhead. Peers can multicast messages that are received by peers in their locality very fast (often faster than in client-server solutions) while players that are further away receive them later or not at all. Not receiving messages from remote players is important in order to not cause the load on each peer to grow with the number of players in the game. Our performance analysis confirms that our solution allows for dynamic game worlds of practically unlimited size, only limited in scale by the number of players within the vision range.

On the Impact of Greedy Strategies in BitTorrent Networks: The Case of BitTyrant###The success of BitTorrent has fostered the development of variants to its basic components. Some of the variants adopt greedy approaches aiming at exploiting the intrinsic altruism of the original version of BitTorrent in order to maximize the benefit of participating to a torrent. In this work we study BitTyrant, a recently proposed strategic client. BitTyrant tries to determine the exact amount of contribution necessary to maximize its download rate by dynamically adapting and shaping the upload rate allocated to its neighbors. We evaluate in detail the various mechanisms used by BitTyrant to identify their contribution to the performance of the client. Our findings indicate that the performance gain is due to the increased number of connections established by a BitTyrant client, rather than for its subtle uplink allocation algorithm; surprisingly, BitTyrant reveals to be altruistic and particularly efficient in disseminating the content, especially during the initial phase of the distribution process. The apparent gain of a single BitTyrant client, however, disappears in the case of a widespread adoption: our results indicate a severe loss of efficiency that we analyzed in detail. In contrast, a widespread adoption of the latest version of the mainline BitTorrent client would provide increased benefit for all peers.

Free-Riding, Fairness, and Firewalls in P2P File-Sharing###Peer-to-peer file-sharing networks depend on peers uploading data to each other. Some peers, called free-riders, will not upload data unless there is an incentive to do so. Algorithms designed to prevent free-riding typically assume that connectivity is not a problem. However, on the Internet, a large fraction of the peers resides behind a firewall or NAT, making them unable to accept incoming connections. In this paper, we will prove that it is impossible to prevent free-riding when more than half of the peers are firewalled, and we will provide bounds on the sharing ratios (defined as the number of bytes uploaded divided by the number of bytes downloaded) of both firewalled and non-firewalled peers. Firewall puncturing techniques are complex but can be used to connect two firewalled peers; we will provide a bound on their required effectiveness in order to achieve fairness.We confirm our theory by simulating individual BitTorrent swarms (sets of peers that download the same file), and show that the theoretical bounds can be met in systems with many firewalled peers. We have also collected statistics covering thousands of BitTorrent swarms in several communities, both open and closed; the latter ban peers if their sharing ratios drop below a certain treshhold. We found 45% of the peers to be firewalled in the closed communities, as opposed to 66% in the open communities, which correlates with our theory that to obtain fair sharing ratios for all peers, at most half of them can be behind firewalls.

Visualizing Transactional Algorithms for DHTs###The focus of this demonstrator is on the study of algorithms for implementing transactions on peer-to-peer networks. Their visualization contributes to the analysis and test of the protocols, verifying their tolerance to failures. In particular, we show a DHT running two-phase commit and the Paxos consensus algorithm.
4627263
A NAT Traversal Mechanism for Peer-To-Peer Networks###In this demo we present our approach for establishing a communication channel between hosts behind a NAT-based router. To do so, we developed a peer-to-peer based variant of the STUN protocol using so-called superpeers. Using this protocol we determine the used NAT types for the hosts and select a suitable NAT traversal technique dynamically.

Chordella - A Hierarchical Peer-to-Peer Overlay Implementation for Heterogeneous, Mobile Environments###This paper deals with Chordella, a peer-to-peer system that is particularly designed for heterogeneous environments such as in wireless networks. We use a pool of standard personal computers distributed over the Internet which act as reliable nodes and form the backbone of the network as superpeers. The mobile nodes are represented by mobile phones running a lightweight implementation of our system able to use the superpeers as proxies. The demo shows the effectiveness of the approach with a mobile picture sharing application benefiting from several improvements such as load balancing and optimal operation point selection algorithms.

IgorFs: A Distributed P2P File System###IgorFs is a distributed, decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) file system that is completely transparent to the user. It is built on top of the Igor peer-to-peer overlay network, which is similar to Chord, but provides additional features like service orientation or proximity neighbor and route selection. IgorFs offers an efficient means to publish data files that are subject to frequent but minor modifications. In our demonstration we show two use cases for IgorFs: the first example is (static) software-distribution and the second example is (dynamic) file distribution.
4627266
EAD: An Efficient and Adaptive Decentralized File Replication Algorithm in P2P File Sharing Systems###In peer-to-peer file sharing systems, file replication technology is widely used to reduce hot spots and improve file query efficiency. Most current file replication methods replicate files in all nodes or two endpoints on a client-server query path. However, these methods either have low effectiveness or come at a cost of high overhead. This paper presents an Efficient and adaptive decentralized file replication algorithm (EAD) that achieves high query efficiency and high replica utilization at a significantly low cost. EAD enhances the utilization of file replicas by selecting query traffic hubs and frequent requesters as replica nodes, and dynamically adapting to non-uniform and time-varying file popularity and node interest. Unlike current methods, EAD creates and deletes replicas in a decentralized self-adaptive manner while guarantees high replica utilization. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of EAD in comparison with other approaches in both static and dynamic environments. It dramatically reduces the overhead of file replication, and yields significant improvements on the efficiency and effectiveness of file replication in terms of query efficiency, replica hit rate and overloaded nodes reduction.
4627267
Flexible Routing in Grouped DHTs###In most DHTs proposed so far, all nodes are assumed to be homogeneous, and all messages are routed using a common algorithm. In practice, however, nodes in large-scale systems might be heterogeneous with respect to their capabilities, reputations, affiliations of administrative domains, and so on, which consequently makes it preferable to distinguish the heterogeneity of participant nodes. To achieve this, in this paper we present grouped tapestry (GTap), a novel tapestry-based DHT that supports organizing nodes into groups and allows flexible DHT routing. The effectiveness of our proposals is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations.
4627264
P2P Information Retrieval and Filtering with MAPS###In this demonstration paper we present MAPS, a novel system that combines approximate information retrieval and filtering functionality in a peer-to-peer setting. In MAPS, a user is able to submit one-time and continuous queries, and receive matching resources and notifications from selected information sources. The selection of these sources in the retrieval case is based on well-known resource selection techniques for peer-to-peer query routing, while in the filtering case a combination of resource selection and novel behavior prediction techniques using time-series analysis of publisher statistics is used. The integration of the two functionalities is done in a seamless way utilizing the same machinery: a conceptually global, but physically distributed directory of statistics about information sources based on distributed hash tables.

Hierarchical Codes: How to Make Erasure Codes Attractive for Peer-to-Peer Storage Systems###Redundancy is the basic technique to provide reliability in storage systems consisting of multiple components. A redundancy scheme defines how the redundant data are produced and maintained. The simplest redundancy scheme is replication, which however suffers from storage inefficiency. Another approach is erasure coding, which provides the same level of reliability as replication using a significantly smaller amount of storage. When redundant data are lost, they need to be replaced. While replacing replicated data consists in a simple copy, it becomes a complex operation with erasure codes: new data are produced performing a coding over some other available data. The amount of data to be read and coded is d times larger than the amount of data produced. This implies that coding has a larger computational and I/O cost, which, for distributed storage systems, translates into increased network traffic. Participants of peer-to-peer systems have ample storage and CPU power, but their network bandwidth may be limited. For these reasons existing coding techniques are not suitable for P2P storage. This work explores the design space between replication and the existing erasure codes. We propose and evaluate a new class of erasure codes, called hierarchical codes, which aims at finding a flexible trade-off that allows the reduction of the network traffic due to maintenance without losing the benefits given by traditional codes.

Designs and Evaluation of a Tracker in P2P Networks###The "tracker" of a P2P system is used to lookup which peers hold (or partially hold) a given object. There are various designs for the tracker function, from a single-server tracker, to multiple-server tracker system, to DHT-based serverless systems. In this paper, we classify the different designs, discuss the different considerations for these designs, and simple models to evaluate the reliability of these designs.

Scalable Resource Annotation in Peer-to-Peer Grids###Peer-to-peer grids are large-scale, dynamic environments where autonomous sites share computing resources. Producing and maintaining relevant and up-to-date resource information in such environments is a challenging problem, due to the grid scale, the resource heterogeneity, and the variety of user demand. This work proposes a peer-to-peer annotation approach where users can freely annotate available resources as a solution to this problem. We advocate that the proposed approach (i) is scalable, as the job of updating the resource information is divided among users; (ii) will improve resources' utilization, by reducing the amount of resources which are allocated to users without matching their applications constraints; and (iii) will allow resource allocators to increase users' utility, leveraging access to more detailed preference descriptions. The paper also discusses the challenges in implementing and deploying such approach and present solutions to tackle these challenges.
4627268
Support for Concept Hierarchies in DHTs###Concept hierarchies greatly help in the organization and reuse of information and are widely used in a variety of applications, such as data warehouses. In this paper, we describe a method for efficiently storing and querying data organized into concept hierarchies and dispersed over a DHT. In our method, peers individually decide on the level of indexing according to the incoming queries. Roll-up and drill-down operations are performed on a per-node basis in order to minimize the number of floods for answering queries on varying levels of granularity. Initial experimental results support this argument on a variety of workloads.

Towards an Incentive Mechanism for Peer-to-Peer Multimedia Live Streaming Systems###Incentive mechanisms are essential components of peer-to-peer systems for file sharing such as BitTorrent, since they enforce peers to share their resources and to participate. Recent P2P systems that distribute live multimedia streams take their inspiration from BitTorrent, but have not defined incentive mechanisms appropriate to the nature of continuous media. In this article, we uncover the way that the incentive mechanisms in BitTorrent are not well suited to streaming live multimedia, and based on P2P systems that we have measured, we propose a new incentive mechanism designed for distribution of live multimedia streaming over a P2P network.

ProtoPeer: From Simulation to Live Deployment in One Step###Simulators are a commonly used tool in peer-to-peer systems research. However, they may not be able to capture all the details of a system operating in a live network deployment. Transitioning from simulation to the actual system implementation is a non-trivial and time-consuming task, a problem that we propose to solve in this paper. We present ProtoPeer, a peer-to-peer systems prototyping toolkit that allows for switching between the event-driven simulation and live network deployment without changing any of the application code. ProtoPeer exports a set of APIs for message passing, message queuing, timer operations as well as overlay routing and managing the overlay neighbors. Users can plug in their own custom implementations of most of the parts of ProtoPeer including custom network models for simulation and custom message passing over transports other than the default TCP/UDP.

Faster Content Access in KAD###Many different distributed hash tables (DHTs) have been designed, but only few have been successfully deployed. The implementation of a DHT needs to deal with practical aspects (e.g. related to churn, or to the delay) that are often only marginally considered in the design. In this paper, we analyze in detail the content retrieval process in KAD, the implementation of the DHT Kademlia that is part of several popular peer-to-peer clients. In particular, we present a simple model to evaluate the impact of different design parameters on the overall lookup latency. We then perform extensive measurements on the lookup performance using an instrumented client. From the analysis of the results, we propose an improved scheme that is able to significantly decrease the overall lookup latency without increasing the overhead.

Multidimensional Range Query and Load Balancing in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks###Sensor networks are usually composed by spatially distributed devices able to monitor physical or environmental conditions (pressure, temperature, motion, etc.). This kind of networks were originally built with the idea of transmitting elementary information to external sinks for further processing and querying. Nowadays, the growth of sensors memory and computational capability together with the significant reduction of energy consumptions have changing the potential of sensor networks allowing in-network storage and processing. The W-Grid infrastructure follows a data centric approach that indexes data according to any number of attributes so that it is possible to query events of interest through multi-dimensional range queries. Differently from existing data centric solutions W-Grid does not use either sensors physical position (i.e. GPS) nor estimation of their positions. For this reason W-Grid can be applied to a wider number of scenarios than existing solutions, as it works both indoor and outdoor, and can be easily suitable to other kind of ad-hoc networks, such as mesh networks and wireless community networks. In this paper we describe how W-Grid is able to efficiently managing and querying data in wireless sensor networks and we report, by means of an extensive number of simulations, several performance measures of its efficiency in comparison with a well-know competitor solution in literature.

CYBER: A CommunitY-Based sEaRch engine###In this paper, we propose CYBER, a CommunitY Based sEaRch engine, for information retrieval utilizing community feedback information in a DHT network. In CYBER, each user is associated with a set of user profiles that capture his/her interests. Likewise, a document is associated with a set of profiles-one for each indexed term. A document profile is updated by users who query on the term and consider the document as a relevant answer. Thus, the profile acts as a consolidation of users feedback from the same community, and reflects their interests. In this way, as one user finds a document to be relevant, another user in the same community issuing a similar query will benefit from the feedback provided by the earlier user. Hence, the search quality in terms of both precision and recall is improved. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study and the results show the effectiveness of our scheme.

A P2PSIP Demonstrator Powered by OverSim###A fundamental problem in studying peer-to-peer networks is the evaluation of new protocols. This commonly involves both the simulation of the protocol in a large-scale network as well as the testing of the protocol in connection with real applications in networks like PlanetLab. To facilitate these tasks we developed the overlay simulation framework OverSim. It was designed to fulfill a number of requirements that have been partially neglected by existing simulation frameworks. In our demonstrator we show how OverSim can not only be used to simulate overlay protocols in large-scale networks, but also demonstrate its real-world capabilities by means of a P2PSIP testbed.

Running the Windows P2P Infrastructure on Mobile Phones###The recent desktop versions of Windows (XP SP2 and Vista) include a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) infrastructure that simplifies the development and deployment of true P2P applications. We have ported the latest version of this infrastructure to Windows Embedded CE 5.0, which is the underlying OS for Windows Mobile 5.0. To our knowledge, this is the first native implementation of a P2P infrastructure for Windows Mobile. This paper provides a short overview of the infrastructure and design considerations when running P2P applications on mobile phones. For demonstration purposes, we have developed a community-based photo sharing and chat application that solely uses the P2P infrastructure for communication. We will demonstrate the ease of creating P2P communities in an ad-hoc manner, and the interoperability between Windows Mobile and Windows Vista.

PEPINO: PEer-to-Peer network INspectOr###PEPINO is a simple and effective peer-to-peer network inspector. It visualises not only meaningful pointers and connections between peers, but also the exchange of messages between them, providing a useful tool for debugging purposes. It can monitor running networks, simulate them and log them in order to reproduce interesting case scenarios. Failures can be explicitly introduced to study fault tolerant algorithms. The graphical representation of the network uses a physical model to attract or repel peers, allowing the user to study the system from different points of view. This demo aims to present the use of PEPINO in the development of a novel relaxed-ring topology for fault tolerant networks, where the representation of the ring based on predecessors may differ from the ring based on successors. We show how PEPINO is also useful for visualising other network topologies such as perfect ring or unstructured networks.

The Effect of Viral Media on Business Usage of P2P###P2P file-sharing poses a number of serious problems for business network administrators including: unpredictable network usage, increased vulnerability to security threats and the danger of legal action. Due to these problems, most businesses attempt to restrict the use of P2P. This paper and the associated demonstration explore the nature of business participation in P2P and particularly highlight the effect of viral media on the participation of large businesses in P2P networks.

PISA: P2P Wi-Fi Internet Sharing Architecture###The demand for cheap broadband Internet for nomadic users has created a market for Internet sharing. Wi- Fi communities which allow their users to share their wired Internet connections have emerged and become increasingly popular. Organizations like FON promise to provide free wireless Internet access in many places. However, user authentication is the Achilles heel of these systems. A user that allows other community members to use its access point must expect to be held responsible for other users' actions. Moreover, these Wi-Fi sharing systems are often insecure which allows eavesdroppers to gather sensitive information on the wireless link. This work provides efficient, scalable, and secure access control for large Wi-Fi sharing systems. The host identity protocol (HIP) is used as a building block for a solution which supports strong user authentication as well as mobility support for nomadic users. In our presentation, we show the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach by demonstrating the PISA authentication protocol in action.

Impact of Vertical Handovers on Cooperative Content Distribution Systems###In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a P2P- based content distribution system in heterogeneous, wireless networks. The mobile users coordinate each other with cooperation strategies enabled by the multi-source download mechanism, as in eDonkey or BitTorrent. Due to the mobility, vertical handovers between different wireless access technologies are required which may result in transmission delays and IP address changes of the switching peer. Hence, connections among users have to be reestablished and downloading users are requeued at a providing peer's waiting queue. In detail, we investigate the impact of requeueing with each VHO as well as the use of mechanisms that preserve the IP address and connections beyond VHOs, like MobilelP. Another important phenomenon occurring with VHOs is the abrupt change of the available bandwidth, e.g., from a fast WLAN connection to a rather slow UMTS connection. We evaluate the download times for files by means of simulation while considering different load scenarios in today's and future network layouts of the B3G network. As a result of the performance evaluation, we derive a new time-based cooperation strategy that counters the impact of mobility. Instead of downloading individual blocks of a file, a user gets a time slot at a providing peer. We show that this leads to a significant performance gain.

A DHT-based Infrastructure for Content-based Publish/Subscribe Services###Publish/subscribe model has become a prevalent paradigm for building distributed event delivering systems. Content-based publish/subscribe allows high expresses in subscriptions and thus is more appropriate for content dissemination. However, the scalability has remained a challenge in the design of distributed content-based publish/subscribe systems due to the expensive matching and delivering cost of content-based events. In this paper we propose an infrastructure built on top of distributed hash table for efficient content-based data distribution. Based on efficient subscription installation, event publication and event delivery mechanisms, the proposed infrastructure can simultaneously support any numbers of pub/sub schemas with different number of attributes. There are three key features in our design: (1) a locality-preserving hashing mechanism which partitions and maps the content space to nodes. Subscriptions and events are mapped to the corresponding node for efficiently matching; (2) an efficient event delivery algorithm which exploits the embedded trees in the underlying DHT to deliver events to the corresponding subscribers; (3) light-weighted load balancing mechanisms to adjust the load among peers and ensure that no peer is unduly loaded.

Distributed, Automatic File Description Tuning in Peer-to-Peer File-Sharing Systems###Peers in peer-to-peer file-sharing systems cannot effectively share their files if they are poorly described. Terms one user employs to describe an instance of a file may not be those that are commonly associated with the file, making this instance difficult to locate. To alleviate this problem, a server can ask its peers for help in improving the description of files they have in common. We consider the design of a fully distributed, automatic system for the exchange of descriptive metadata. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques are effective in improving search accuracy with reasonable cost.

Cooperative Keep-Alives: An Efficient Outage Detection Algorithm for P2P Overlay Networks###One of the challenges of today's overlay networks, especially P2P, is still scalability. A key issue in almost all of the current overlay architectures is the link count per single node. If the link count is too high, the management overhead in terms of keep-alive messages increases. If the amount of links per node is too low, the resilience of the system against network splits decreases and the system can hardly route in an optimal way. Moreover, if keep-alive messages are not sent frequently enough, outdated information could be propagated, which again could cause net splits. This paper presents a new cooperative keep-alive algorithm that strongly reduces the costs for sending keep- alive messages and, at the same time, preserves the effectiveness and reliability of standard keep-alive mechanisms in today's overlay networks. The algorithm allows to increase the number of links per node, and, thus, to improve the connectivity and routing efficiency in the network, while keeping the keep-alive overhead low. When used without increasing the link count, the algorithm reduces drastically the keep-alive traffic. The properties of the algorithm are evaluated analytically and simulatively and compared to existing keep-alive techniques.

A Data Placement Scheme with Time-Related Model for P2P Storages###Maintaining desired data availability while minimizing costs is the primary challenge in designing P2P storages. Data placement schemes and data availability calculation methods are two key design choices. Prior work has used the random placement and steady-state availability analysis model widely. We find this approach has two drawbacks: (1) it ignores the time-related property and greatly underestimates data availability in the short term and (2) it ignores differences in peers' availability and uses a mean value, which also leads to the underestimation of data availability. Both of these drawbacks influence the efficiency of storage and bandwidth resource usage. Also, this approach can not ensure all the objects achieve their expected availability due to the second drawback. This paper develops a different data placement scheme called similar-MTTF-MTTR placement, which takes into consideration differences in pees' dynamic characteristics. Under this scheme, this paper also presents a fine-gained analysis model for short-term data availability calculation. As a result, our scheme improves the efficiency of data maintaining significantly. We validate this by comparing with random placement under three different dynamic environments: a wide-area system (PlanetLab), a corporative environment (desktop personal computers at Microsoft Corporation), and a file-sharing system (Maze). The results show that our scheme can save the storage resource usage significantly under all environments.

An End-to-End Solution to Scalable Unstructured P2P Networking###Despite many improvements on original unstructured P2P networks, these systems still suffer from many problems, the most important of which are, (a) lack of guarantees on the integrity of the network topology in the face of churns, (b) excessive traffic cost, and (c) poor quality of search results. This paper introduces an end-to-end scalable unstructured P2P networking solution called SUPNET to address many of these issues. The solution consists of two sub-protocols, SUPNET-T and SUPNET-S, which are, respectively, responsible for network management and search. We investigate the end-to-end performance of our solution, both analytically and empirically. SUPNET-T is a scalable, highly robust protocol, capable of utilizing the heterogenous distribution of network resources. The high stability of SUPNET-T is the result of implementation of a novel distributed feedback mechanism. SUPNET-S, on the other hand, is capable of locating every item, even if a single copy of that item exists in the network. SUPNET-S does this while producing a traffic that scales provably sub-linear with the network size. The protocol also contains mechanisms for efficient search of popular items as well as distributed tuning algorithms. All this, along with a relative ease of implementation and a solid analytical foundation, make SUPNET a compelling solution for unstructured P2P networking.

Handling Network Partitions and Mergers in Structured Overlay Networks###Structured overlay networks form a major class of peer- to-peer systems, which are touted for their abilities to scale, tolerate failures, and self-manage. Any long-lived Internet-scale distributed system is destined to face network partitions. Although the problem of network partitions and mergers is highly related to fault-tolerance and self-management in large-scale systems, it has hardly been studied in the context of structured peer-to-peer systems. These systems have mainly been studied under churn (frequent joins/failures), which as a side effect solves the problem of network partitions, as it is similar to massive node failures. Yet, the crucial aspect of network mergers has been ignored. In fact, it has been claimed that ring-based structured overlay networks, which constitute the majority of the structured overlays, are intrinsically ill-suited for merging rings. In this paper, we present an algorithm for merging multiple similar ring-based overlays when the underlying network merges. We examine the solution in dynamic conditions, showing how our solution is resilient to churn dur- ng the merger, something widely believed to be difficult or mpossible. We evaluate the algorithm for various scenar- os and show that even when falsely detecting a merger, the algorithm quickly terminates and does not clutter the network with many messages. The algorithm is flexible as the tradeoff between message complexity and time complexity can be adjusted by a parameter.

An Efficient Eigenvalue-based P2P XML Routing Framework###Many emerging applications that use XML are distributed, usually over large peer-to-peer (P2P) networks on the Internet. The deployment of an XML query shipping system over P2P networks requires a specialized synopsis to capture XML data in routing tables. In this paper, we propose a novel eigenvalue-based routing synopsis for deployment over unstructured P2P networks. Based on well-established Cauchy's interlacing theorem, our approach employs multiple eigenvalues as routing synopsis and facilitates query routing process with computationally-inexpensive range inequality checking. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

On Routing in Distributed Hash Tables###There have been many proposals for constructing routing tables for distributed hash tables (DHT). They can be classified into two groups: A) those that assume that the peers are uniformly randomly distributed in the identifier space, and B) those that allow order-preserving hash functions that lead to a skewed peer distribution in the identifier space. Good solutions for group A have been known for many years. However, DHTs in group A are limited to use randomized hashing and therefore, queries over whole identifier ranges thus do not scale. Group B can handle such queries easily. However, it is more difficult to connect the peers such that the resulting topology provides efficient routing, small routing tables, and balanced routing load. We present an elegant new solution to construct an efficient DHT for group B. Our main idea is to decouple the identifier space from the routing topology. In consequence, our DHT allows arbitrarily skewed peer distributions in the identifier space and does not require the overhead of sampling. Furthermore, the table construction is cheap and does not require active replacement of lost routing entries. To evaluate the performance of routing cost and table construction under high churn, we built an efficient simulator. Using the right data structures, we can easily process the state of over one million peers in RAM.

Mapping Small Worlds###Social networks are usually navigable small worlds: individuals are able to find short chains of acquaintances connecting pairs of unrelated nodes. This property can be explained by the fact that nodes are characterized by a series of properties, such as geographical position, work or educational background; the navigation proceeds towards the node that is "most similar" to the destination. Since nodes are likely to be linked with similar individuals, this strategy permits to quickly reach the destination. We approach the problem of creating the information that makes a network navigable. Starting from a given network, and without any other information, we show how nodes can reconstruct, with a scalable and decentralized algorithm, a "network map": a d-dimensional layout that places nodes in a way that reflects the network structure, so that navigability is achieved. Euclidean distance on the layout is used as a measure for node similarity, and efficient routing can be simply achieved by iteratively jumping towards the neighbor that is closest to the destination. The network map provides a means for implementing routing on social networks that can be used in "darknets", that is, anonymous networks where nodes establish connections only if they are mutually trusted. Moreover, the distance between nodes on the network map can be used as a measure of node affinity, and may help in various types of network analysis, for instance to help evaluate reputation in webs of trust, or in order to perform "personalized" ranking.

Peer-to-Peer Rating###This paper proposes to utilize algorithms from the probabilistic graphical models domain for Peer-to-Peer rating of data items and for computing "social influence" of nodes in a Peer-to-peer social network. We evaluate the practicality of our approach using large- scale simulations over a MSN Live Messenger subgraph consisting of about a million nodes. Our algorithms are general since they can be used for Peer-to-peer monitoring and for the efficient computation of other node ranking methods, such as PageRank and Information Centrality.

Self-Stabilization in Preference-Based Networks###Participants in a decentralized system often use some local ranking information in selecting effective collaborations. We say that such systems are preference-based for most practical types of preferences, such systems converge towards a unique stable configuration. In this paper, we investigate the speed and quality of the convergence process with respect to the model parameters. Our results provide insight into the design of system parameters, such as the number of connections or the algorithm for choosing new partners.

Grid Resource Scheduling with Gossiping Protocols###Grid resource providers can use gossiping to disseminate their available resource state to remote regions of the grid to attract application load. Pairwise gossiping protocols exchange information about limited subsets of other resources between pairs of potentially remote participants. In epidemic gossiping protocols, the provider disseminates information to multiple neighbors, who in turn forward it to their neighbors, and so on. One important metric for these protocols is their coverage, which characterizes how many and which resources receive the information. Coverage characteristics of epidemic protocols are non-uniform, concentrated within the vicinity of a disseminating node; they can exhibit bi-modal behavior where information either reaches distant nodes or dies out quickly. Pairwise gossiping protocols, on the other hand, provide a more uniform coverage, but it can take longer for the dissemination to reach desired uniformity. In this paper, we study performance characteristics of three gossiping protocols: (1) epidemic gossiping, (2) pairwise gossiping, and (3) adaptive information dissemination (which is based on a form of epidemic gossiping). We report experimental results based on our simulation framework that compare the three protocols in terms of packet overhead and query satisfaction rates. We show that pairwise gossiping protocols work best when resource distribution on the grid is uniform, but that they can be configured to perform well in support of grid scheduling.

Private Peer-to-Peer Overlay for Real-Time Monitoring of a Deployed Internet-Scale Peer-to-Peer Overlay###Peer-to-peer system decentralization complicates performance monitoring-and real-time monitoring is particularly challenging. We discuss our experience with monitoring the Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP), a peer-to-peer name resolution/routing protocol and overlay deployed over the Internet. We must collect accurate performance data without adding traffic overhead. Unfortunately, no central node has sufficient monitoring information, and scalability and privacy concerns make it impractical to collect reliable real-time data from active client nodes. Our method obtains information from lightweight nodes (Weather Stations) actively deployed on the P2P network and themselves forming a private P2P overlay. We monitor the overall performance of the PNRP protocol on the Internet and produce timely reports supporting network management, security alerting, and system maintenance.

P2P-IM: A P2P Presence System for the Internet###Traditional instant messaging applications rely on central server infrastructure to broker user information. The cost and complexity of this infrastructure makes it difficult for developers to build and deploy lightweight presence and instant messaging systems within their own applications. In this paper, we describe P2P-IM, a peer-to-peer instant messaging client that does not rely on any hosted server infrastructure. The system provides the rich facilities available from traditional client-server systems but enables easy deployment and integration with existing applications. The solution provides simplified identity generation, connectivity, and rich per-application data publication.

The BitCod Client: A BitTorrent Clone using Network Coding###Network coding is an emerging field of research with sound and mature theory supporting it. Recent works shows that it has many benefits like improved fault tolerance, higher flexibility in selection of file parts to transfer and resiliency to network partitions [4, 3]. Despite those appealing properties there is no wide usage of network coding in real file sharing applications. In this work, we try to bridge the gap between theory of network coding and practice. From the one hand, we deploy one the most successful file sharing client, the BitTorrent client. We use the BitTorrent algorithm for optimizing the neighbor selections for maximizing the upload bandwidth. From the other hand, we propose several simple heuristics that improve significantly the efficiency of the network coding deployed. In a nutshell, we propose computation intensive variant of network coding that can be applied to most of the existing network coding protocols. By changing the random selection of coded parts to a selection based on feedback from the network, we significantly improve the network utilization and the efficiency of the protocol. In this paper we report our work in progress building the BitCod client. Using extensive simulations we demonstrate that our technique can compete with the performance of the state-of-the-art BitTorrent [2] file sharing client. Next, we plan to implement and test a prototype of the BitCod client over the WAN.

Fabric: Synergistic Proximity Neighbour Selection Method###In this paper, verification of a synergistic, two-staged method for self-optimization of DHT-based overlay networks is presented. The method, named Fabric, minimizes overlay network stretch during a node insertion by using static, readily available information that does not involve costly periodic probing of many nodes. Furthermore, Fabric enables an overlay to optimize its topology at runtime in an adaptive manner.

How stable are large superpeer networks against attack?###In this paper, we analyze the stability of large scale superpeer networks against attack. Two different kinds of attacks namely deterministic and degree dependent attack have been introduced. We model the superpeer networks with the help of bimodal degree distribution and different attacks with the help of graph dynamics. It is interesting to observe from both theoretical and simulation results that peer degree plays the key role for maintaining stability of the superpeer networks in face of these two attacks.

The Design and Evaluation of Techniques for Route Diversity in Distributed Hash Tables###We present a replica placement scheme for any distributed hash table that uses a prefix-matching routing scheme and evaluate the number of replicas necessary to produce a desired number of disjoint routes. We show through simulation that this placement can make a significant improvement in routing robustness over other placements. Furthermore, we consider another route diversity mechanism that we call neighbor set routing and show that, when used with our replica placement, it can successfully route messages to a correct replica even with a quarter of the nodes in the system failed at random. Finally, we demonstrate a family of replica query strategies that can trade off response time and system load. We present a hybrid query strategy that keeps response time low without producing too high a load.

Rescuing Tit-for-Tat with Source Coding###Tit-for-tat is widely believed to be the most effective strategy to enforce collaboration among selfish users. However, it has been shown that its usefulness for decentralized and dynamic environments such as peer-to-peer networks is marginal, as peers can rapidly end up in a deadlock situation. Many proposed solutions to this problem are either less resilient to freeloading behavior or induce a computational overhead that cannot be sustained by regular peers. In contrast, we retain tit-for-tat, but enhance the system with a novel form of source coding and an effective scheme to prevent peers from freeloading from seeding peers. We show that our system performs well without the risk of peer starvation and without sacrificing fairness. The proposed solution has a reasonably low overhead, and may hence be suitable for fully distributed content distribution applications in real networks.
4343459
Bounds on the Performance of P2P Networks Using Tit-for-Tat Strategies###Current P2P systems employ tit-for-tat strategies, where peers only upload when they are simultaneously downloading, to avoid free riding. We derive optimal tit-for-tat strategies and obtain theoretical bounds on the performance of any P2P network employing such strategies. These are fundamental limitations that stem from peers unwillingness to cooperate without getting something in return. We show that the number of cooperating peers in a tit-for-tat strategy can, at best, grow linearly in time, as opposed to exponentially for a fully cooperative strategy. However, tit-for-tat strategies are fairer than a fully cooperative strategy. Our results show that there exists a seed capacity threshold for tit-for-tat strategies. Increasing seed capacity beyond this threshold brings significantly reduced marginal gains.

An Information-Theoretic Framework for Analyzing Leak of Privacy in Distributed Hash Tables###An important security issue in DHT-based structured overlay networks is to provide anonymity to the storage nodes. Compromised routing tables in those DHTs leak information about other nodes in the system and therefore compromise privacy. In this paper, we use information theory to build a model to quantify the information leak from compromised routing tables for a given DHT with certain routing geometry and route table size. Based on this model, we have analyzed and compared how existing DHTs perform in face of anonymity attacks. We found that ring-based routing geometry (Chord) performs the best among the studied DHTs with the same routing complexity when no routing optimizations are used. The analysis of the interaction between routing geometries and recipient anonymity will help improve the design of future DHTs which can achieve a balance between routing efficiency and robustness against information leak.

Modelling Real P2P Networks: The Effect of Altruism###We develop a model of the interaction of rational peers in an incentive-free peer-to-peer (P2P) network and use game theoretic analysis to derive results about peer and network behavior. We calculate and discuss Nash equilibria and predict peer behavior in terms of individual contribution. At the heart of our model is altruism, an intrinsic parameter reflecting peers inherent willingness to contribute. Two different approaches for modelling altruistic behavior and its attendant benefit are introduced and discussed. We consider the cases of P2P networks of peers that (i) have homogeneous altruism levels or (ii) have heterogeneous altruism levels, but with known probability distributions. We find that, under the effects of altruism, a substantial fraction of peers will contribute when altruism levels are within certain intervals, even though no incentive mechanism is used. Our results corroborate empirical evidence of large P2P networks surviving or even flourishing without or with barely functioning incentive mechanisms.
4343463
A Trust-Based Exchange Framework for Multiple Services in P2P Systems###In this paper we propose fully distributed trust-based policies for p2p systems to regulate the exchange of different type of services and discourage misbehaviour. In a system of peers with different service valuations and capabilities, the resource allocation and server selection policies are based on local reputation vectors, whose elements are the reputations of the peers in providing each service of the system. Our studies demonstrate that proposed policies lead to the dynamic formation of coalitions (cooperation) among peers, which mutually profit by the exchange of their services, without pre-existing knowledge of one another's capabilities and values of services. In this way utilities of all peers progressively increase. Only misbehaving (non contributive) peers do not benefit by such a system, as proposed policies efficiently recognize and block misbehaviour.

Attacking a Swarm with a Band of Liars: evaluating the impact of attacks on BitTorrent###BitTorrent has become one of the most popular Internet applications, given the number of users and the fraction of the Internet traffic it consumes. Its wide adoption has exposed some potential problems, like selfish peer behavior. Related research efforts so far have focused on modeling the dynamics of swarms, as well as devising incentive mechanisms that improve fairness without sacrificing efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to evaluate the impact of attacks that exploit BitTorrent vulnerabilities with the sole intention of harming a swarm. The paper sheds light on BitTorrent behavior by presenting state diagrams, describes two attacks, and then evaluates their negative impact in realistic swarm settings. To evaluate the impact of attacks, a discrete-event simulator was developed and validated against an experimental evaluation performed in a controlled environment. Our findings show the seriousness of the problem and should be the basis for the development of new mechanisms to increase BitTorrent security.

A Feasibility Study on Defending Against Ultra-Fast TopologicalWorms###Self-propagating worms have been terrorizing the Internet for several years and they are becoming imminent threats to large-scale Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems featuring rich host connectivity and popular data services. In this paper, we consider topological worms, which exploit P2P host vulnerabilities and topology information to spread in an ultra-fast way. We study the feasibility of leveraging the existing P2P overlay structure for distributing automated security patches to vulnerable machines. Two approaches are examined: a partition-based approach, which utilizes immunized hosts to proactively stop worm spread in the overlay graph, and a Connected Dominating Set(CDS)-based approach, which utilizes a group of dominating nodes in the overlay to achieve fast patch dissemination in a race with the worm. We demonstrate through analysis and simulations that both methods can result in effective worm containment.

Reputation Systems for Fighting Pollution in Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Systems###Content pollution is a de facto problem in several currently popular Peer-to-Peer file sharing systems. Previously proposed strategies to fight content pollution include a peer reputation system named Scrubber as well as the alternative Credence object reputation system. This paper builds on previous work into three directions. First, it evaluates the cost-effectiveness of Scrubber and Credence in reducing pollution dissemination when polluters make use of collusion and Sybil attacks. Second, it modifies the Scrubber system to increase its effectiveness, in particular under collusion. Finally, it proposes a hybrid peer and object reputation system that combines the benefits of both strategies. We performed an extensive evaluation of all three systems, for various configurations and pollution mechanisms, as well as collusion and Sybil attacks. Our results show that the new hybrid system is much more effective and robust to malicious actions than any individual strategy, even in very uncooperative and unreliable peer communities.

Predicting Query Duplication with Box-Jenkins Models and Its Applications###Many previous works of Peer-to-Peer traffic characterization and modeling focused their attention on the distribution of query contents. However, few has been done towards a better understanding of the time series distribution of these queries, which is vital for system performance. To remedy this situation, this paper characterizes query traffic by using automatic time series analysis to evaluate different linear models(Box-Jenkins models and some simple windowed-mean models) for predicting the number of duplicated queries from 10 minutes to 2 hours into the future. Both the predictive power and the computational costs of these models are evaluated over 318,942,450 real world Gnutella queries collected over 3 months. We find the number of duplicated queries is consistently predictable. Simple, practical models like AR perform well on prediction. To show that these characteristics have a wide range of potential applications, we propose two enhancement to existing search results caching and load balancing algorithms. Our simulation study shows that our methodology works quite well in both scenarios in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The main contribution of this paper lies in: (1) proposing new measurement techniques on Gnutella, (2) characterizing and modeling peer-to-peer query traffic with Box-Jenkins Models, (3) presenting a general enhancement to existing performance optimization algorithm in P2P systems.

Completeness Estimation of Range Queries in Structured Overlays###Range queries are a very powerful tool in a wide range of data management systems and are vital to a multitude of applications. The hierarchy of structured overlay systems can be utilized in order to provide efficient techniques for processing them, resulting in the support of applications and techniques based on range queries in large-scale distributed information systems. But, due to the limited knowledge and the usually best-effort characteristics, deciding about the completeness of query results, e.g., getting an idea when a query is finished or what amount of results is still missing, is very challenging. There is not only an urgent need to provide this information to the user issuing queries, but also for implementing sophisticated and efficient processing techniques based on them. In this work, we propose a method for solving this task. We discuss the applicability and quality of our estimations, present an implementation and evaluation for the P-grid system and show how to adapt the technique to other overlays.

Price of Structured Routing and Its Mitigation in P2P Systems under Churn###We study the resilience of structured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks in the presence of churn. Using the lifetime-based failure assumptions, we first show that a realistic churn model has an equivalent uniform failure model in the steady state. We then determine via percolation analysis and simulation the gap between the size of the connected component and the reachable component of a randomly picked node for symphony and chord. This gap represents the price of structured routing: the size of the set of nodes that are reachable by any unstructured routing method (e.g. broadcast on the unstructured overlay) from a randomly picked surviving node, but are not reachable using structured routing on the structured overlay. As an illustration, for 24- minute average node lifetime with 1-minute average node-search delay, the gap is around 12 thousand nodes or 1.2% in a chord network of around 1 million nodes. We finish by discussing potential techniques to mitigate the price of structured routing.

Globase.KOM - A P2P Overlay for Fully Retrievable Location-based Search###Location based services are becoming increasingly popular as devices that determine geographical position become more available to end users. The main problem of existing solutions to location-based search is keeping information updated requires centralized maintenance at specific times. Therefore, retrieved results do not include all objects that exist in reality. A peer-to-peer (P2P) approach can easily overcome this issue as peers are responsible for the information users are searching for. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art overlays cannot fulfill the requirements for efficient and fully retrievable location-based search. In this paper we present Globase.KOM, a hierarchical tree-based P2P overlay that enables fully retrievable location-based overlay operations which proved to be highly efficient and logarithmically scalable.

Comparison of Robust Cooperation Strategies for P2P Content Distribution Networks with Multiple Source Download###The performance of peer-to-peer (P2P) content distribution networks depends highly on the coordination of the peers. Sophisticated cooperation strategies, such as the multiple source download, are the foundation for efficient file exchange. The detailed performance of the strategies are determined by the peer characteristics and the peer behaviour, such as the number of parallel upload connections, the selfishness, or the altruistic re-distribution of data. The purpose of this work is to evaluate and investigate different cooperation strategies for multiple source download and select the best one for a scenario for even leeching peers, i.e. peers which depart as soon as they have finished their download. The question arises whether the cooperation strategy can smoothen the overall performance degradation caused by a selfish peer behaviour. As performance indicator the evolution of the numbers of copies of a chunk and the experienced download times of files is applied. The considered scenarios comprise best-case (altruistic peers) and worst-case scenarios (selfish peers). We further propose a new cooperation strategy to improve the file transfer even when mainly selfish peers are present, the CygPriM (cyclic priority masking) strategy. The strategy allows an efficient P2P based content distribution using ordered chunk delivery with only local information available at a peer

Bandwidth Trading in Unstructured P2P Content Distribution Networks###Bandwidth trading schemes give peers an incentive to provide upload bandwidth to other peers in a P2P network for fast file distribution. A popular example is the tit-for-tat strategy used in the BitTorrent protocol. Although this game theoretical scheme provides an incentive to peers to contribute resources to the network it does not prevent unfairness and the performances of peers vary considerably. Therefore, we propose two new trading schemes, which are based on pricing. One uses explicit price information whereas the other scheme uses the download rates from other peers as the price. For both distributed algorithms the stable point provides a fair resource allocation as well as a Nash equilibrium, i.e. fairness is preserved although peers behave selfishly and try to maximise their own download rates only. We compare both pricing schemes with BitTorrent in simulations of static and dynamic networks. The pricing algorithms outperform BitTorrent with respect to fairness. With explicit prices the download rates converge faster to the fair equilibrium than with implicit ones

eQuus: A Provably Robust and Locality-Aware Peer-to-Peer System###Peer-to-peer systems (p2p) are highly dynamic in nature. They may consist of millions of peers joining only for a limited period of time, resulting in hundreds of join and leave events per second. In this paper we introduce eQuus, a novel distributed hash table (DHT) suitable for highly dynamic environments. eQuus guarantees that lookups are always fast - in terms of both the delay and the total number of routing hops -, although peers may join and leave the network at any time and concurrently

GosSkip, an Efficient, Fault-Tolerant and Self Organizing Overlay Using Gossip-based Construction and Skip-Lists Principles###This paper presents GosSkip, a self organizing and fully distributed overlay that provides a scalable support to data storage and retrieval in dynamic environments. The structure of GosSkip, while initially possibly chaotic, eventually matches a perfect set of Skip-list-like structures, where no hash is used on data attributes, thus preserving semantic locality and permitting range queries. The use of epidemic-based protocols is the key to scalability, fairness and good behavior of the protocol under churn, while preserving the simplicity of the approach and maintaining O(log(N)) state per peer and O(log(N)) routing costs. In addition, we propose a simple and efficient mechanism to exploit the presence of multiple data items on a single physical node. GosSkip's behavior in both a static and a dynamic scenario is further conveyed by experiments with an actual implementation and real traces of a peer to peer workload

2Fast : Collaborative Downloads in P2P Networks###P2P systems that rely on the voluntary contribution of bandwidth by the individual peers may suffer from free riding. To address this problem, mechanisms enforcing fairness in bandwidth sharing have been designed, usually by limiting the download bandwidth to the available upload bandwidth. As in real environments the latter is much smaller than the former, these mechanisms severely affect the download performance of most peers. In this paper we propose a system called 2Fast, which solves this problem while preserving the fairness of bandwidth sharing. In 2Fast, we form groups of peers that collaborate in downloading a file on behalf of a single group member, which can thus use its full download bandwidth. A peer in our system can use its currently idle bandwidth to help other peers in their ongoing downloads, and get in return help during its own downloads. We assess the performance of 2Fast analytically and experimentally, the latter in both real and simulated environments. We find that in realistic bandwidth limit settings, 2Fast improves the download speed by up to a factor of 3.5 in comparison to state-of-the-art P2P download protocols

Scalable Blind Search and Broadcasting in Peer-to-Peer Networks###Typical blind search algorithms in P2P networks generate a significant amount of duplicate query messages to increase the success rate. We present a framework, named recursive partitioning search (RPS), for blind search over structured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, by which the query message duplication can be avoided. Two realizations of the framework for Chord and Pastry are presented. With simulation model, we compare success rate, lookup delay and overlay network load of RPS and various well-known blind search algorithms, and show RPS is the superior blind search algorithm running over a DHT. The algorithm guarantees that with high probability the lookup delay to visit every peer is of O(log N) hops, comparable to the delay of the exact match search over the DHTs. With RPS, every node in the overlay network is visited not more than once by design. These characteristics qualify the recursive partitioning search over DHT as an efficient broadcasting algorithm. We investigate RPS scalability and propose the way to choose an appropriate time-to-live (TTL) parameter value to maintain the balance between high success rate and reasonable network load

Cost-Based Analysis of Hierarchical DHT Design###Flat DHT architectures have been the main focus of the research on DHT design so far. However, there have been also a number of works proposing hierarchical DHT organizations and pointing their advantages. They mostly rely on the intuitive understanding that hierarchy is desirable in any complex system. In this paper we formalize this intuition within a general cost-based framework. We provide a cost model of a specific hierarchical DHT organization composed of superpeers and leafnodes, and show that the costs of running the network are not necessarily minimized for flat DHT organization, providing thus a formal motivation for hierarchical DHTs. We further hint on what distributed algorithms can be applied in practice to reach optimal operating point of the network

Self-Organizing Content Distribution in a Data Indexed DHT Network###The paper discusses the access-skew problem in a data indexed DHT network. The difference in popularity of data indexes is likely to create access hotspots that overwhelm the host node. The capability of relieving heavily loaded nodes is essential to the scalability of an overlay network. In this paper, we propose an effective content distribution method to relieve hotspots in a self-organizing manner. An algorithm is given to reduce the query traveling distance and balance the load among replica nodes. Moreover, we give a small-world model based algorithm to reduce the load-balancing cost. Experiment results show that the mechanism significantly reduces the number of dropped queries and the average query delay while keeping load-balancing cost under control

Analytical Study on Improving DHT Lookup Performance under Churn###The phenomenon of churn degrades the lookup performance of DHT-based P2P systems greatly. To date, a number of approaches have been proposed to handle it from both the system side and the client side. However, there lacks theoretical analysis to direct how to make design choices under different churn levels and how to configure their parameters optimally. In this paper, we analytically study three important aspects on improving DHT lookup performance under churn, i.e., lookup strategy, lookup parallelism and lookup key replication. Our objective is to build a theoretical basis for DHT designers to make better design choices in the future. We first compare the performance of two representative lookup strategies - recursive routing and iterative routing, and explore the existence of better alternatives. Then we show the effectiveness of parallel lookup in systems with different churn levels and how to select the optimal degree of parallelism. Due to the importance of key replication on lookup performance, we also analyze the reliability of replicated keys under two different replication policies, and discuss how to make configuration in different environments. Besides analytical study, our results are also validated by simulation, and Kad is taken as a case to show the meaningfulness of our analysis

P^22P - Prepaid Peer-to-Peer Services###Since the early days of file sharing, the quest for incentives persuading users to contribute resources to P2P networks exists. Crediting and debiting users' accounts for consumptions and contributions is surely one possibility. But how to do this without enormous additional overhead or infrastructure? We depict a solution to this question by describing the establishment of a lightweight, secure prepaid charging mechanism within a P2P network

A Middleware-based Telecom Service Architecture for Peer-to-peer Networks###The emergence of peer-to-peer (p2p) Internet telephony is now enabling telecom service architectures to adopt a p2p model. However, there are certain services that require explicit network support. In this paper, we propose and describe the design of a middleware based service architecture to enable the telecom services, including those requiring explicit network support, in p2p networks

Internet Scale Testing of PNRP Using WiDS Network Simulator###PNRP (peer name resolution protocol) is a decentralized name resolution and routing protocol built into the Windowstrade operating system that creates an Internet-scale peer-to-peer structured overlay. Ensuring the protocol's performance in Internet scale presents a critical challenge. We describe Internet scale testing of PNRP using a distributed network simulator, WiDS. We use real-world Internet characteristics and PNRP node behaviors to simulate the Internet environment, assess PNRP performance, and support protocol debugging. A case study demonstrates identification of a protocol flaw that could otherwise only be discovered through full-scale deployment experience

Experiences Developing Mobile P2P Applications with LightPeers###In this paper, our experiences so far with developing a platform for mobile P2P applications with the LightPeers framework are presented. We experienced that the use of a role-based approach in the initial application development phase showed useful. The roles provide a high-level abstraction for common peer behavior within a session, and are suitable for describing a specific setup of peers, e.g., when developing a new system

A Reciprocation-Based Economy for Multiple Services in Peer-to-Peer Grids###In this paper we study reciprocation-based mechanisms to encourage donation in peer-to-peer grids in which multiple services, such as processing power and data transfers, are shared explicitly. We have modeled such a system and established how peers should assess whether it is profitable to exchange services with another peer, an issue that is not present in the single service case. Unfortunately, this assessment relies on information provided by untrustworthy peers. As an alternative, we have extended, to the case of multiple services, a reciprocation-based mechanism which uses only reliable information gathered locally. We have assessed this mechanism by simulating scenarios in which services are exchanged that are combinations of two different basic services. In the explored scenarios the mechanism performs very well, and can marginalize free riders even when the cost to peers of donating a service is nearly as large as the utility gained by receiving it

Towards Scalable Mobility in Distributed Hash Tables###For the use in the Internet domain, distributed hash tables (DHTs) have proven to be an efficient and scalable approach to distributed content storage and access. In this paper, we explore how DHTs and mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) fit together. We argue that both share key characteristics in terms of self organization, decentralization, redundancy requirements, and limited infrastructure. However, node mobility and the continually changing physical topology pose a special challenge to scalability and the design of a DHT for mobile ad-hoc networks. In this paper, we show that with some local knowledge we can build a scalable and mobile structured peer-to-peer network, called mobile hash table (MHT). Furthermore, we argue that with little global knowledge, such as a map of the city or whatever area the nodes move in, one can even further improve the scalability and reduce DHT maintenance overhead significantly, allowing MHT to scale up to several ten thousands of nodes

W-Grid: a Cross-Layer Infrastructure for Multi-Dimensional Indexing, Querying and Routing in Wireless Ad-Hoc and Sensor Networks###Large scale wireless ad-hoc networks of computers, sensors, PDAs etc. (i.e. nodes) are revolutionizing connectivity and leading to a paradigm shift from centralized systems to highly distributed and dynamic environments. A plethora of routing algorithms have been proposed for the network path discovery ranging from broadcasting/flooding-based approaches to those using Global Positioning Systems (GPS). In this paper we propose a novel decentralized infrastructure that self-organizes wireless devices in an ad-hoc network, where each node has one or more virtual coordinates through which both message routing and data management occur without reliance on either flooding/broadcasting operations or GPS. The resulting ad-hoc network does not suffer from the dead-end problem, which happens in geographic-based routing when a node is unable to locate a neighbor closer to the destination than itself. The multi-dimensional data management capability will be described showing, as an example, how the location service reduces to a simple query, like for any other data type. Extensive performance analysis and experiments have been conducted and the results compared to GPSR, which is considered the most efficient routing solution not using broadcast operations. Our approach shows significant performance gains

Video Streaming on the Internet Using Split and Merge Multicast###Application-level multicast overcomes the problems linked with IP-multicast and provides an effective mechanism to support media streaming. One key problem associated with this approach is the restriction on the content that can be distributed because the upstream capacity of the peers is utilized to forward content to other peers. As the upstream capacity of most peers is restricted, Webcasting high-bandwidth content is a continuing problem with traditional application-level multicasting techniques. Split and merge multicast provides a solution to this problem. This paper presents the results of a large-scale field trial of the technology

Reinforcement Learning for Query-Oriented Routing Indices in Unstructured Peer-to-Peer Networks###The idea of building query-oriented routing indices has changed the way of improving routing efficiency from the basis as it can learn the content distribution during the query routing process. It gradually improves routing efficiency with no excessive network overhead of the routing index construction and maintenance. However, the previously proposed mechanism is not practically effective due to the slow improvement of routing efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for query-oriented routing indices which quickly achieves high routing efficiency at low cost. The maintenance method employs reinforcement learning to utilize mass peer behaviors to construct and maintain routing indices. It explicitly uses the expected value of returned content number to depict the content distribution, which helps quickly approximate the real distribution. Meanwhile, the routing method is to retrieve as many contents as possible. It also helps speed up the learning process further. The experimental evaluation shows that the mechanism has high routing efficiency, quick learning ability and satisfactory performance under churn

Comparison of Image Similarity Queries in P2P Systems###Given some of the recent advances in distributed hash table (DHT) based peer-to-peer (P2P) systems we ask the following questions: are there applications where unstructured queries are still necessary (i.e., the underlying queries do not efficiently map onto any structured framework), and are there unstructured P2P systems that can deliver the high bandwidth and computing performance necessary to support such applications. Toward this end, we consider an image search application which supports queries based on image similarity metrics, such as color histogram intersection, and discuss why in this setting, standard DHT approaches are not directly applicable. We then study the feasibility of implementing such an image search system on two different unstructured P2P systems: power-law topology with percolation search, and an optimized super-node topology using structured broadcasts. We examine the average and maximum values for node bandwidth, storage and processing requirements in the percolation and super-node models, and show that current high-end computers and high-speed links have sufficient resources to enable deployments of large-scale complex image search systems
1698598
Conjunction Dysfunction: The Weakness of Conjunctive Queries in Peer-to-Peer File-sharing Systems###Peers in peer-to-peer file-sharing systems use conjunctive queries as a way of controlling query cost in the absence of information about the behavior of other peers. Conjunctive queries are good at increasing the precision of query result sets, but may be overly selective, decreasing overall performance. We consider relaxing the conjunctive matching criterion and its impact on performance and cost. Experimental results indicate that significant performance improvements are possible at reasonable cost
1698597
Cost-Aware Processing of Similarity Queries in Structured Overlays###Large-scale distributed data management with P2P systems requires the existence of similarity operators for queries as we cannot assume that all users agree on exactly the same schema and value representations and data quality problems due to spelling errors and typos. In this paper, we present an approach for efficient processing of similarity selections and joins in a structured overlay. We show that there are several possible strategies exploiting DHT features to a different extent (i.e., key organization, routing, multicasting) and thus the choice of the best operator implementation in a given situation (selectivity, data distribution, load) should be based on cost information allowing the system to estimate the computation and communication costs of query execution plans. Hence, we present a cost model for similarity operations on structured data in a DHT and demonstrate the efficiency of our proposal by experimental results from a large-scale PlanetLab deployment
1698596
Tag Indexed DHT for Scalable Search Infrastructure in Social NetworkApplications###Social applications associate a set of user defined keywords named tags when publishing social objects in order to locate them later. We propose T-DHT, a hybrid unstructured-structured DHT based approach, to cope with the high demanding requirements of social applications, in a fully scalable, distributed and balanced way. T-DHT behaves as a structured DHT when publishing "tag, social-object" associations, and as an unstructured filter driven network when searching for the social-objects by means of any tag combination. The publishing process stores tag information across node links in order to drive adequately the later search operations in at most O(Log(N)). The search process takes at most O(logN) node hops for any tag combination and uses the previously stored node link tag information. Although T-DHT has been devised to build a scalable social application infrastructure, it can also be applied to solve general peer-to-peer keyword search problems

Solving Overlay Mismatching of Unstructured P2P Networks using Physical Locality Information###This paper addresses overlay topology mismatching problem by presenting "AM", an effective way to measure nodes' relative distance and a technique called "CTAG" to construct topology-aware Gnutella overlay. The approach excels in sending no extra messages to probe the target nodes, avoiding the extra traffic and delay time, while keeping the necessary accuracy

Schema Caching for Improved XML Query Processing in P2P Systems###The advent and popularity of the World Wide Web (WWW) has enabled access to a variety of semi-structured data and, when available, this data follows some common XML schema. On the other hand the distribution of content has made centralized solutions inappropriate, entering the era of peer-to-peer (P2P) computing, where content is stored in XML databases residing on peers. In this paper, we propose XML schema caching as a summary indexing technique for searching in P2P networks. We study XML query routing in unstructured P2P networks, comparing different search strategies and showing the advantages of our approach in terms of completeness of the search
1698593
Route Fingerprinting in Anonymous Communications###Peer discovery and route set-up are an integral part of the processes by which anonymizing peer-to-peer systems are made secure. When systems are large, and individual nodes only gain random knowledge of part of the network, their traffic can be detected by the uniqueness of the information they have learnt. We discuss this problem, which occurred in the initial design of Tarzan, and other related problems from the literature
1698592
Multi-Dimensional Prefix Search in P2P Networks###We present a simple yet novel technique for prefix search in P2P networks. The idea is to extract characters and their position information in a keyword to index objects. Our index scheme can achieve quite balanced loads, avoid hop-spots and single point of failure, reduce storage and maintenance costs, and offer some ranking mechanisms for matching objects. We use 2.412.613 CD records collected in FreeDB (http://freedb.org) as experimental dataset to test our index scheme
1698591
The Effect of Replica Placement on Routing Robustness in Distributed Hash Tables###To achieve higher efficiency over their unstructured counterparts, structured peer-to-peer systems hold each node responsible for serving a specified set of keys and correctly routing lookups. Unfortunately, malicious participants can abuse these responsibilities to deny access to a set of keys or misroute lookups. We look to address both of these problems through replica placement. Using Chord as an example, we present an equally-spaced replication scheme and prove that it can be tuned to produce any desired number of disjoint routes. To be specific, we prove that d disjoint routes can be produced by placing 2<sup>d-1 </sup> replicas around a fully populated Chord ring in an equally-spaced fashion. In this situation, we also prove that there exists a route to at least one replica, which contains only uncompromised nodes, even if an attacker controls more than a quarter of the contiguous identifier space in the system. Simulation experiments demonstrate that this scheme performs better than previously proposed replica placement schemes in rings that are sparsely populated, populated in clusters, or populated partially by compromised nodes

Cuckoo Ring: BalancingWorkload for Locality Sensitive Hash###Locality sensitive hash (LSH) is widely used in peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Although it can support range or similarity queries, it breaks the load balance mechanism of traditional distributed hash table (DHT) based system by replacing consistent hash with LSH. To solve the imbalance problem, current systems either weaken the locality preserve ability from similarity preserved to order preserved or adopt load aware peer join mechanism. The first method does not support similarity query as it loses the similarity information and the second method is greatly affected by the dynamic nature of P2P networks. In this paper, we propose a novel system, cuckoo ring, which can preserve similarity information while load balanced. It does not guide the newly joining peer to the hot areas but move the items in the hot areas to cold areas so that the short life time peers are distributed uniformly across the network instead of being guided to the hot areas. Compared to traditional DHT systems, cuckoo ring only maintains a little more information about the global light load peers and the moved indexed items

Defense against Intrusion in a Live Streaming Multicast System###Application-level multicast systems are vulnerable to attacks that impede nodes from receiving desired data. Live streaming protocols are especially susceptible to packet loss induced by malicious behavior. We describe SecureStream, an application-level live streaming system built using a pull-based architecture that results in improved tolerance of malicious behavior. SecureStream is implemented as a layer running over Fireflies, an intrusion-tolerant membership protocol. Our paper describes the SecureStream system and offers simulation and experimental results confirming its resilience to attack

Certificate-based Access Control in Pure P2P Networks###Pure peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are characterized as being extremely decentralized and self-organized, properties which are essential in a number of environments, including teamwork, collaborative, and ad-hoc systems. One of the features offered by P2P networks is the possibility of having several replicas of the same content distributed among multiple nodes. Despite its advantages (e.g. robustness and fault tolerance), it is crucial to guarantee content authenticity, as well as to enforce appropriate access control policies. However, the extremely decentralized nature of these environments makes impossible to apply classic solutions that rely on some kind of fixed infrastructure, typically in the form of on-line trusted third parties. In a previous work, we presented a protocol for content authentication based on public key certificates that does not rely on the existence of a public key infrastructure. In this paper, we show how these certificates can be extended to provide authorization capabilities. In our scheme, each peer classifies her contents according to several security labels. Peers allowed to access a given content must have a security clearance of at least the same level that the content's. These security clearances, which take the form of attributes in public key certificates, can be discretionally issued by the content provider
1698607
Computational Puzzles as Sybil Defenses###We consider the problem of defending against Sybil attacks using computational puzzles. A fundamental difficulty in such defenses is enforcing that puzzle solutions not be reused by attackers over time. We propose a fully decentralized scheme to enforce this by continually distributing locally generated challenges that are then incorporated into the puzzle solutions. Our approach consists of an all-to-all broadcast of challenges, with a combining function to ensure this can be done efficiently. The combining function generates certificates that can be used to prove that each node's challenge was delivered to and used by each other node, therefore proving the freshness of each puzzle. We show how our distribution and verification mechanisms can be implemented on top of the the Chord in Stoica et al., (2001) overlay
1698606
Risk Driven Semantic P2P Service Retrieval###In this paper, we present a novel approach, named RS2D, to risk driven semantic service query routing in unstructured, so called pure P2P networks. Following the RS2D protocol, each peer dynamically learns about the query answering behavior of its direct neighbours, without prior knowledge on the semantic overlay. The decision to whom to forward a given service request is then driven by the estimated mixed individual Bayes' conditional risk of routing failure in terms of both semantic loss and high communication costs. The results of our experimental evaluation of retrieval performance and robustness show that RS2D top performs compared to other relevant systems
1698605
Peer-to-Peer Error Recovery for Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial Networks###Media companies (and other organizations with large amounts of digital content) require prompt broadcast of extremely large files from a single source to a collection of geographically dispersed destinations. Due to the high cost of terrestrial networks of sufficient bandwidth, satellite networks are commonly used for such transfers. However, current satellite transfers rely on expensive error correction via forward error correction and whole-file retransmission. This paper presents a new, hybrid solution combining the advantages of satellite and terrestrial networks to provide cost-effective reliable file transfer. Specifically, we propose a new peer-to-peer scheme exploiting fast terrestrial networks and multiple receivers to recover from high loss rates (5% or more) in near real-time (latency &lt; 400ms). This solution is efficient, robust under variable packet loss and connectivity, user tunable, scales well, and doubles bandwidth compared to existing approaches. The system has been validated via extensive simulations using a terrestrial network based on the AT&amp;T common backbone core network
1698604
State Aware Data Dissemination over Structured Overlays###We describe the problem of data dissemination in stream-oriented applications where the required filter is a function of the current state. We call such functions dynamic filters. A state aware data dissemination network (SA-DDN) is proposed to support dynamic filters. Two approaches single-level filtering (SF) and multilevel filter decomposition (MFD) are proposed to facilitate the data dissemination. We show how MFD improves performance over SF. We then describe a realization of SA-DDN on top of an improved bi-directional Chord overlay with a built-in multicast mechanism. An application of stock price monitoring is implemented based on SA-DDN and real life stock quotes are collected to demonstrate the feasibility of our system. Extensive simulations are performed to compare the performance of both approaches and provide insight into the advantages of MFD

Internet-Scale Storage Systems under Churn -- A Study of the Steady-State using Markov Models###Content storage in a distributed collaborative environment uses redundancy for better resilience and thus provides good availability and durability. In a peer-to-peer environment, where peers continuously leave and rejoin the network, various lazy strategies can be employed to maintain a minimal redundancy of stored content in the system. Existing static resilience analyses fail to capture in detail the system's behavior over time, particularly the probability mass function of the actual available redundancy, since it ignores the crucial interplay between churn and maintenance operations, and looks only at the average system property. We perform a Markovian time-evolution analysis of the system specified by probability mass function of each possible system state, and establish that given a fixed rate of churn and a specific maintenance strategy, the system operates in a corresponding steady-state (dynamic equilibrium). Understanding the behavior of the system under such a dynamic equilibrium is a fundamental ingredient to precisely evaluate analytically the system's performance and availability as well as to determine the required operational maintenance cost. We also propose a new randomized variant of a lazy-maintenance scheme which has significant performance benefits in comparison to the existing deterministic procrastination based maintenance. We demonstrate the use of our analysis methodology in comparing performance of maintenance schemes using the examples of the new maintenance scheme we propose and the erstwhile best known existing lazy maintenance scheme. The comparative study shows that our randomized lazy maintenance strategy has substantially better resilience at same maintenance cost
1698602
Implicit Group Messaging over Peer-to-Peer Networks###We propose a decoupled distribution paradigm for connecting large numbers of content publishers and consumers called implicit group messaging (IGM). Unlike traditional multicast or publish/subscribe messaging, IGM delivers content to "implicit groups" of consumers matching combinations of attributes specified by the publisher at the time of publication. The contributions of this paper include a characterisation of IGM encompassing the types of groups that must be supported, and an innovative distributed P2P implementation that we compare via simulation to a functionally equivalent client/server approach. Our results show the P2P model to efficiently support a range of implicit groups with acceptable delivery times and vastly less maximum peer and link stress than a client/server approach
1698601
Ordered Slicing of Very Large-Scale Overlay Networks###Recently there has been an increasing interest to harness the potential of P2P technology to design and build rich environments where services are provided and multiple applications can be supported in a flexible and dynamic manner. In such a context, resource assignment to services and applications is crucial. Current approaches require significant "manual-mode" operations and/or rely on centralized servers to maintain resource availability. Such approaches are neither scalable nor robust enough. Our contribution towards the solution of this problem is proposing and evaluating a gossip-based protocol to automatically partition the available nodes into "slices", also taking into account specific attributes of the nodes. These slices can be assigned to run services or applications in a fully self-organizing but controlled manner. The main advantages of the proposed protocol are extreme scalability and robustness. We present approximative theoretical models and extensive empirical analysis of the proposed protocol

Dynamic Prefix Tree for Service Discovery within Large Scale Grids###Within computational grids, some services (software components, linear algebra libraries, etc.) are made available by some servers to some clients. In spite of the growing popularity of such grids, the service discovery, although efficient in many cases, does not reach several requirements. Among them, the flexibility of the discovery and its efficiency on wide-area dynamic platforms are two major issues. Therefore, it becomes crucial to propose new tools coping with such platforms. Emerging peer-to-peer technologies provide algorithms allowing the distribution and the retrieval of data items while addressing the dynamicity of the underlying network. We study in this paper the service discovery in a pure peer-to-peer environment. We describe a new trie-based approach for the service discovery that supports range queries and automatic completion of partial search strings, while providing fault-tolerance, and partially taking into account the topology of the underlying network. We validate this approach both by analysis and simulation. Traditional metrics considered in peer-to-peer systems exhibits interesting complexities within our architecture. The analysis' results are confirmed by some simulation experiments run using several grid's data sets

The Orchard Algorithm: P2P Multicasting without Free-Riding###The main purpose of many current peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is off-line file sharing. However, a potentially very promising use of such networks is to share video streams (e.g., TV programs) in real time. In order to do so, the peers in a P2P network who are interested in the same video stream may employ application level multicasting (ALM). In existing P2P networks, peers may exhibit behaviour which is problematic for ALM: peers tend not to donate any resources (free-riding), and they arrive and depart at a high rate (churn). In this paper we propose the orchard algorithm for ALM of video streams in P2P systems, which deal with both these problems. By employing a technique called multiple description coding, we split a video stream into several substreams. Orchard creates a dynamic spanning tree for each of these substreams in such a way that in the re suiting forest, no peer has to forward more substreams than it receives. Our experiments show that orchard is capable of providing a good quality of service to every peer, even when peers join and leave the forest at a high rate

Quantifying agent strategies under reputation###Our research proposes a simple buyer/seller game that captures the incentives dictating the interaction between peers in resource trading peer-to-peer networks. We prove that for simple reputation-based buyer strategies, a seller's decision whether to cheat or not is dependent only on the length of its transaction history, not on the particular actions committed. Given a finite number of transactions, a peer can compute a utility optimal sequence of cooperations and defections. With the limited information provided by many reputation systems, a peer has incentive to defect on a large fraction of its transactions. If temporal information is used, equilibrium is reached when peers predominantly cooperate.

Chord on demand###Structured peer-to-peer overlay networks are now an established paradigm for implementing a wide range of distributed services. While the problem of maintaining these networks in the presence of churn and other failures is the subject of intensive research, the problem of building them from scratch has not been addressed (apart from individual nodes joining an already functioning overlay). In this paper we address the problem of jump-starting a popular structured overlay, Chord, from scratch. This problem is of crucial importance in scenarios where one is assigned a limited time interval in a distributed environment such as Planet-Lab, or a grid, and the overlay infrastructure needs to be set up from the ground up as quickly and efficiently as possible, or when a temporary overlay has to be generated to solve a specific task on demand. We introduce T-Chord, that can build a Chord network efficiently starting from a random unstructured overlay. After jump-starting, the structured overlay can be handed over to the Chord protocol for further maintenance. We demonstrate through extensive simulation experiments that the proposed protocol can create a perfect Chord topology in a logarithmic number of steps. Furthermore, using a simple extension of the protocol, we can optimize the network from the point of view of message latency.

Trusted computing: providing security for peer-to-peer networks###In this paper, we demonstrate the application of trusted computing to securing peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. We identify a central challenge in providing many of the security services within these networks, namely the absence of stable verifiable peer identities. We employ the functionalities provided by trusted computing technology to establish a pseudonymous authentication scheme for peers and extend this scheme to build secure channels between peers for future communications. In support of our work, we illustrate how commands from the trusted computing group (TCG) specifications can be used to implement our approach in P2P networks.

Peer-to-peer direct sales###The article describes and gives an economic analysis of a business model for commercial content delivery networks (CDN) based on the peer-to-peer model. The content is stored in the CDN on the hosts of the peers. A user pays for access to the content, and can sell the content to other users as in a direct sales network. The content trade is a free market transaction (including billing and accounting) handled by superpeers, who receive a markup for their services and pay the content provider a gratification for every transaction. The system makes use of reputation mechanisms with a goal contrary to most P2P research: to promote content trading and discourage sharing for free.

Range queries in trie-structured overlays###Among the open problems in P2P systems, support for nontrivial search predicates, standardized query languages, distributed query processing, query load balancing, and quality of query results have been identified as some of the most relevant issues. This paper describes how range queries as an important nontrivial search predicate can be supported in a structured overlay network that provides O(log n) search complexity on top of a trie abstraction. We provide analytical results that show that the proposed approach is efficient, supports arbitrary granularity of ranges, and demonstrate that its algorithmic complexity in terms of messages is independent of the size of the queried ranges and only depends on the size of the result set. In contrast to other systems which provide evaluation results only through simulations, we validate the theoretical analysis of the algorithms with large-scale experiments on the PlanetLab infrastructure using a fully-fledged implementation of our approach.

Cyclone: a novel design schema for hierarchical DHTs###Recent research efforts have improved the existing flat distributed hash tables to accommodate hierarchical structure. Nevertheless, many problems still remain to be solved regarding scalability issues, autonomous systems, connection degree, and network proximity. In this paper, we present a new hierarchical DHT called Cyclone that aims to solve the aforementioned issues with a near-optimal architecture. Cyclone provides optimal logarithmic routing hops without establishing unnecessary connection links to other nodes. Our approach follows a horizontal and uniform leaf-based approach that considerably reduces the overall number of links per node. Furthermore, Cyclone also offers a disjoint multipath routing scheme that benefits from network proximity and thus creates a more robust overlay infrastructure.

Elders know best - handling churn in less structured P2P systems###We address the problem of highly transient populations in unstructured and loosely-structured peer-to-peer systems. We propose a number of illustrative query-related strategies and organizational protocols that, by taking into consideration the expected session times of peers (their lifespans), yield systems with performance characteristics more resilient to the natural instability of their environments. We first demonstrate the benefits of lifespan-based organizational protocols in terms of end-application performance and in the context of dynamic and heterogeneous Internet environments. We do this using a number of currently adopted and proposed query-related strategies, including methods for query distribution, caching and replication. We then show, through trace-driven simulation and wide-area experimentation, the performance advantages of lifespan-based, query-related strategies when layered over currently employed and lifespan-based organizational protocols. While merely illustrative, the evaluated strategies and protocols clearly demonstrate the advantages of considering peers' session time in designing widely-deployed peer-to-peer systems.

Techniques for efficient routing and load balancing in content-addressable networks###As a distributed hash table (DHT), a content addressable network (CAN) provides efficient routing and object location in a decentralized manner while offering fault tolerance and dynamic peer operations. However, as opposed to other DHTs that use a flat ID space, CAN uses a multi-dimensional logical space. DHTs usually require O(logN) routing information per peer and provide routing in O(logN) hops, where N is the number of peers in the system. In CAN, on the other hand, each peer keeps only constant amount of routing information and the routing takes O(dN<sup>1</sup>d/) hops, where d is the dimensionality of the logical space. Hence the routing performance of CAN is worse than other DHTs especially when d is small. In this paper, we describe and evaluate several schemes for efficient routing in CAN by keeping additional routing information at the peers. Furthermore, due to the underlying multidimensional ID space, CAN is used by applications that require content-based mapping of data objects onto the ID space. Since uniform hashing is not used, such mappings introduce skewed object distributions among the peers. Thus we also describe load balancing schemes for CAN and investigate their efficiency.

Evaluation of mutual trust during matchmaking###The authors introduced a new service discovery and matchmaking architecture, layered on top of Globus MDS3, that integrates mutual trust evaluations into the matchmaking process. The architecture adopts a symmetric approach, and checks trust policies of both grid users and resources without requiring policy disclosures. This approach eliminates run-time security failures arising from incompatible user/resource pairs, seamlessly integrates user-side authorization tools with the matchmaking process, and protects naive grid users by allowing a security principal to define policies that control the list of discoverable resources.

ARA: a robust audit to prevent free-riding in P2P networks###A number of solutions have been proposed to address the free-riding problem in peer-to-peer file sharing systems. The solutions are either imperfect-they allow some users to cheat the system with malicious behavior, or expensive-they require human intervention, require servers, or incur high mental transaction costs. The authors proposed a method to address these weaknesses. Specifically, a utility function was introduced to capture contributions made by a user and an auditing scheme to ensure the integrity of a utility function's values. The method enabled to reduce cheating by a malicious peer: it is shown that this approach can efficiently detect malicious peers with a probability over 98%.

Improving service performance through object replication in middleware: a peer-to-peer approach###The scalability of a distributed service can be improved if the number of replicated instances of the service can vary with the load experienced by the system. To ensure that the number and placement of the replicas can be dynamically changed based on network and load conditions, a peer node must know when it should create a new replica and when such a replica can be removed. A scheme that makes such decisions centrally suffers from a number of problems. In this paper, we propose a self-managing replication algorithm for a peer-to-peer system where a peer node makes its decisions based on its locally maintained information. This algorithm offers several benefits. They include being responsive to heterogeneous load and ensuring that each peer node fairly contributes its available resources to meet the needs of the overall system. It is evaluated with simulations of a system that consists of one thousand nodes. Our results show that this self-managing algorithm can maintain a replication degree that adapts to load in the system and achieve a low response time.

Dynamic and fault-tolerant cluster management###Recent decentralised event-based systems have focused on providing event delivery which scales with increasing number of processes. While the main focus of research has been on ensuring that processes maintain only a small amount of information on maintaining membership and routing, an important factor in achieving scalability for event-based peer-to-peer dissemination system is the number of events disseminated at the same time. This work presents a dynamic and fault tolerant cluster management method which can be used to coordinate concurrent access to resources in a peer-to-peer system. In the context of event-based dissemination systems the cluster management can be used to control the number of concurrently disseminated events. We present and analyse an algorithm implementing the proposed cluster management model in a fault-tolerant and decentralised way. The algorithm provides for each cluster a limited set of tickets. A process which has obtained a ticket may send events corresponding to the resources of the cluster. The algorithm guarantees that no two processes ever issue an event corresponding to the same ticket at the same time. The cluster management model on its own has interesting properties which can be useful for many peer-to-peer applications.

Video management in peer-to-peer systems###Providing scalable video services in a peer-to-peer (P2P) environment is challenging. Since videos are typically large and require high communication bandwidth for delivery, many peers may be unwilling to cache them in whole to serve others. In this paper, the authors addressed two fundamental research problems in providing scalable P2P video services, namely (1) how a host can find enough video pieces, which may scatter among the whole system, to assemble a complete video, and (2) given a limited buffer size, what part of a video a host should cache. A new distributed video management technique was proposed. This scheme organizes hosts into a number of cells, each of which is a distinct set of hosts which together can supply a video in its entirety. A client looking for a video can stop its search as soon as it finds a host that caches any part of the video. Caching operations can be coordinated within each cell to balance data redundancy in the system. The extensive study on a Gnutella-like simulation network shows convincingly the performance advantage of the new scheme.

Presence-based availability and P2P systems###The availability of a P2P service is a function of the individual peers' availabilities, and it is often desirable to estimate how available a particular P2P service will be given the availability of its peers. Prior work in this area has widely used the fraction of time the average peer is available as the basis for this estimate. It is shown that this approach has serious drawbacks. The authors developed a different measure, which is called presence-based availability, which takes into account the availability of the individual peers. Using traces of live P2P systems taken from the literature, the authors demonstrated that presence-based availability is a more reliable indicator of potential performance than prior methods. It is shown that this metrics successfully estimate the availability of a P2P file-sharing system. Then, using presence-based measures to make a better estimate of a parameter in a highly-available system, we achieve a 75% decrease in resource usage relative to an existing technique relying on traditional metrics.

Randomized protocols for duplicate elimination in peer-to-peer storage systems###Distributed peer-to-peer storage systems rely on voluntary participation of peers to effectively manage a storage pool. Files are generally replicated in several sites to provide acceptable levels of availability. If disk space on these peers is not carefully monitored and provisioned, the system may not be able to provide availability for certain files. In particular, identification and elimination of redundant data are important problems that may arise in long-lived systems. Scalability and availability are competing goals in these networks: scalability concerns would dictate aggressive elimination of replicas, while availability considerations would argue conversely. In this paper, the authors provided a novel and efficient solution that addresses both these goals with respect to management of redundant data. Specifically, the problem of duplicate elimination in the context of systems connected over an unstructured peer-to-peer network in which there is no a priori binding between an object and its location was addressed. A new randomized protocol was proposed to solve this problem in a scalable and decentralized fashion that does not compromise availability requirements of the application. Performance results using both large-scale simulations, and a prototype built on PlanetLab, demonstrate that the protocols provide high probabilistic guarantees of success, while incurring minimal administrative overheads.

An effective resource description based approach to find similar peers###In text document sharing peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, similar peers are peers which share documents about the same topic. Finding similar peers can benefit document retrieval in P2P systems. In this paper, the authors suggested an effective resource description based approach to find similar peers. By combining the topic model (an extension of language model) technique and fuzzy set theory, the key problems about resource description generation and peer similarity calculation were solved. Experiments performed on the standard data sets prove that this approach is effective. Especially, comparing with the traditional approach, experimental results in the simulated P2P environment manifest that this approach works much better when only local information is available.

Finding rare data objects in P2P file-sharing systems###Peer-to-peer file-sharing systems have hundreds of thousands of users sharing petabytes of data, however, their search functionality is limited. In general, query results contain many references to the same data object. These references are grouped, and the size of the group - the number of references it contains - metric. Although group size is effective in finding popular data, it works poorly for rare, less popular data. Other ranking functions, such as precision and cosine similarity, are more appropriate in this case. The authors showed the significant performance benefit in finding rare data using these ranking functions through extensive simulation.

Incentives for P2P Fair Resource Sharing###We consider the problem of fair resource sharing to optimize the performance of resource sharing in peer to peer systems. Resource sharing systems currently face rational peers which may exhibit a variety of strategies including: no participation, also referred as free-riding, and greedy behavior. The first aspect has been extensively studied in the late years, while the second one has not received much attention. The broad class of proposed solutions focuses on designing incentives to reward cooperative peers. The side effect of these incentives is twofold: the system load is not balanced and the resource potential of the system is not fully exploited. The P2P fair resource sharing aims at both balancing the load and maximizing the use of system resources. The contribution of our work is twofold. First, we specify the P2P fair resource sharing problem and propose a mechanism to solve it in large scale dynamic networks with rational users. Our mechanism is composed of a novel incentive (i.e. fair cooperation) and an algorithmic part encapsulated in a middleware layer. Second, we propose an architecture for our mechanism middleware layer including four distributed services that bring together several research area: aggregation, semantic group membership and tracking. Finally, we implement our mechanism using a peer-to-peer unstructured model and evaluate it through simulations

P2P-based grid architecture for homology searching###This paper describes an advanced grid architecture efficient for homology searching in bioinformatics. An integrated architecture of the computing-grid and data-grid through P2P communication attains efficient job processing. Field trials, in which broadband users and bioinformatics researchers participated to find new DNAs, show its effectiveness in reducing processing time.
1551033
Keyword searching in hypercubic manifolds###The authors presented a novel approach for keyword searching for file sharing applications based on a simple hash function and extension to current distributed hash tables (DHT) topology. Depart from standard hash methods on DHT systems, this approach is to develop a locality preserving hash function so that objects containing the same keyword tend to have similar hash values under Hamming metric. It is shown that this hash function is locality preserving and proposes the embedding of keyword edges to facilitate query processing. As such, several class of problems in keyword search were reduced into a network multicast problem.

T-DHT: topology-based distributed hash tables###In this paper, the authors introduced topology-based distributed hash tables (T-DHT) as an infrastructure for data-centric storage, information processing, and routing in ad hoc and sensor networks. T-DHTs do not rely on location information and work even in the presence of voids in the network. Using a virtual coordinate system, a distributed hash table which is strongly oriented to the underlying network topology was constructed. Thus, adjacent areas in the hash table commonly have a direct link in the network. Routing in the T-DHT guarantees reachability and introduces low hop-overhead compared with the shortest path.

On the challenge of assessing overlay topology adaptation mechanisms###This thesis is that a peer-to-peer network's overlay topology should adapt to match the demand graph of the peer-to-peer network. In order to assess the effectiveness of various adaptation mechanisms, a comparison with an optimal topology for a given demand graph would be helpful. However, several related optimization/decision problems have been shown to be NP-hard. The contributions of this paper are threefold: i) NP-hardness results related to assessing overlay adaptation strategies were briefly surveyed, ii) a specific optimization problem and metric was presented, and iii) experimental results indicating the potential of optimizing the overlay topology were provided. Finally, in the spirit of a 'challenge paper' various open issues were stated and discussed.

Load balancing issues in super-peer-based publish/subscribe digital libraries###The authors presented a hyper-graph partitioning based approach to the problem of load-balancing in large-scale P2P-based digital libraries. In such libraries, in addition to publishing digital content, peer-clients may subscribe their intent to be notified whenever digital content matching appropriate meta-data keywords is published in the library (a.k.a. continuous queries or selective dissemination of information), as well as perform more traditional point queries. The digital content, as well as the continuous queries, are partitioned among a number of blocks, and each super-peer server in the network is responsible for handling only one of these partitioned blocks. Preliminary results showing that the hyper-graph partitioning approach scales well with the number of published documents or continuous queries, and with the size of the network were presented. The results show that partitioning-based load balancing of the super-peers leads to significant improvements of the average response time for point or continuous queries, and much reduced storage requirements of the library metadata.

Peer-to-peer networks based on hierarchies of trust###A new approach to peer-to-peer (P2P) networking is proposed, which is particularly suitable for real-time interactive multimedia communications over IP networks. This approach combines the concepts of both the hybrid and pure P2P approaches. It enables administration of P2P resources and peer privileges and allows for secure content exchange, while being scalable and robust in its performance as the P2P network grows. The administration is devolved among a 'hierarchy of trust', which can evolve with the cooperation of peers with administrative privileges.

Heterogeneity-aware distributed access structure###Efficient access to distributed and dynamic multidimensional data is vital for applications in large, heterogeneous, decentralized, resource-sharing environments such as grids and peer-to-peer systems. Most systems providing this functionality assume homogeneous participants. This paper proposes HADAS, an access structure exploiting heterogeneity to build a self-aware adaptive information system.

Toward overlay network symbiosis###Simultaneous overlay networks compete for network resources and disrupt each other. If they cooperate with each other, the collective performance can be improved and they can coexist comfortably. Taking inspiration from biology, in this paper the authors presented a model of symbiotic overlay networks. Coexisting overlay networks dynamically evolve, interact with each other, and change their internal structures. Overlay networks in a symbiotic condition eventually establish the strong relationship and finally merge into one. The effect of interconnection of two overlay networks from the viewpoint of the robustness and the rate of message dissemination was also evaluated.

Search with probabilistic guarantees in unstructured peer-to-peer networks###Search is a fundamental service in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. However, despite numerous research efforts, efficient algorithms for guaranteed location of shared content in unstructured P2P networks are yet to be devised. In this paper, the authors presented a simple but highly effective protocol for object location that gives probabilistic guarantees of finding even rare objects independently of the network topology. The protocol relies on randomized techniques for replication of objects (or their references) and for query propagation. The authors proved analytically, and demonstrated experimentally, that this scheme provides high probabilistic guarantees of success, while incurring minimal overhead. The performance of this scheme was quantified in terms of network messages, probability of success, and response time. The robustness of this protocol was also evaluated in the presence of node failures (departures). Using simulation, it is shown that this scheme performs no worse than the best known access-frequency based protocols, without compromising access to rare objects.

Supporting multi-dimensional range queries in peer-to-peer systems###Today's peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are unable to cope well with range queries on multi-dimensional data. To extend existing P2P systems and thus support multidimensional range queries, one needs to consider such issues as space partitioning and mapping, efficient query processing, and load balancing. In this paper, the authors describe a scheme called ZNet, which addresses all these issues. Moreover, an extensive performance study which evaluates ZNet against several recent proposals was conducted, and results show that ZNet possesses nearly all desirable properties, while others typically fail in one or another.

Result verification and trust-based scheduling in peer-to-peer grids###Peer-to-peer grids that seek to harvest idle cycles available throughout the Internet are vulnerable to hosts that fraudulently accept computational tasks and then maliciously return arbitrary results. Current strategies employed by popular cooperative computing grids, such as SETI@Home, rely heavily on task replication to check results. However, result verification through replication suffers from two potential shortcomings: (1) susceptibility to collusion in which a group of malicious hosts conspire to return the same bad results and (2) high fixed overhead incurred by running redundant copies of the task. In this paper, we first propose a scheme called Quiz to combat collusion. The basic idea of Quiz is to insert indistinguishable quiz tasks with verifiable results known to the client within a package containing several normal tasks. The client can then accept or reject the normal task results based on the correctness of quiz results. Our second contribution is the promotion of trust-based task scheduling in peer-to-peer grids. By coupling a reputation system with the basic verification schemes - Replication and Quiz - a client can potentially avoid malicious hosts and also reduce the overhead of verification for trusted hosts.
1551019
Self-stabilizing structured ring topology P2P systems###We propose a self-stabilizing and modeless peer-to-peer (P2P) network construction and maintenance protocol, called the Ring Network (RN) protocol. The RN protocol, when started on a network of peers that are in an arbitrary state, will cause the network to converge to a structured P2P system with a directed ring topology, where peers are ordered according to their identifiers. Furthermore, the RN protocol maintains this structure in the face of peer joins and departures. The RN protocol is a distributed and asynchronous message-passing protocol, which fits well the autonomous behavior of peers in a P2P system. The RN protocol requires only the existence of a bootstrapping system which is weakly connected. Peers do not need to be informed of any global network state, nor do they need to assist in repairing the network topology when they leave. We provide a proof of the self-stabilizing nature of the protocol, and experimentally measure the average cost (in time and number of messages) to achieve convergence.
1551015
Proximity neighbor selection for a DHT in wireless multi-hop networks###A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a multi-hop wireless network having no infrastructure. Thus, the mobile nodes have to perform basic control tasks, such as routing, and higher-level tasks, such as service discovery, in a cooperative and distributed way. Originally conceived as a peer-to-peer application for the Internet, distributed hash tables (DHTs) are data structures offering both, scalable routing and a convenient abstraction for the design of applications in large, dynamic networks. Hence, DHTs and MANETs seem to be a good match, and both have to cope with dynamic, self-organizing networks. DHTs form a virtual control structure oblivious to the underlying network. Several techniques to improve the performance of DHTs in wired networks have been established in the literature. A particularly efficient one is proximity neighbor selection (PNS). PNS has to continuously adapt the virtual network to the physical network, incurring control traffic. The applicability of PNS and DHTs for MANETs commonly is regarded as hard because of this control traffic, the complexity of the adaptation algorithms, and the dynamics of a MANET. Using simulations supported by analytical methods, we show that by making a minor addition to PNS, it is also applicable for MANETs. We additionally show that the specifics of a MANET make PNS an easy exercise there. Thus, DHTs deliver good performance in MANETs.

The essence of P2P: a reference architecture for overlay networks###The success of the P2P idea has created a huge diversity of approaches, among which overlay networks, for example, Gnutella, Kazaa, Chord, Pastry, Tapestry, P-Grid, or DKS, have received specific attention from both developers and researchers. A wide variety of algorithms, data structures, and architectures have been proposed. The terminologies and abstractions used, however, have become quite inconsistent since the P2P paradigm has attracted people from many different communities, e.g., networking, databases, distributed systems, graph theory, complexity theory, biology, etc. In this paper we propose a reference model for overlay networks which is capable of modeling different approaches in this domain in a generic manner. It is intended to allow researchers and users to assess the properties of concrete systems, to establish a common vocabulary for scientific discussion, to facilitate the qualitative comparison of the systems, and to serve as the basis for defining a standardized API to make overlay networks interoperable.

On overlay schemes to support point-in-range queries for scalable grid resource discovery###A resource directory is a critical component of a grid architecture. P2P computing paradigm could address some of the scalability issues that make distributed resource discovery services challenging. Unfortunately, most existing distributed hash table (DHT) based P2P overlays have difficulty in treating attribute range queries that are common in resource discovery lookups. This paper proposes a general framework for range-based resource discovery. In particular, the proposed framework maps tree-structured logical data (i.e., range indexing) onto a DHT-based physical node space (i.e., resource brokers). In this paper, we consider three mapping schemes from the logical space onto the physical space. Each mapping scheme uses a different replication mechanism to reduce range search time and to achieve load balance. We analytically and experimentally compare the performance characteristics (query/update costs and workload distributions) of these schemes and discuss their applicability under different resource discovery service scenarios.

Efficient query evaluation on large textual collections in a peer-to-peer environment###The authors studied the problem of evaluating ranked (top-k) queries on textual collections ranging from multiple gigabytes to terabytes in size. The authors focused on the case of a global index organization in a highly distributed environment, and consider a class of ranking functions that includes common variants of the Cosine and Okapi measures. The main bottleneck in such a scenario is the amount of communication required during query evaluation. Several efficient query evaluation schemes were proposed and their performances were evaluated. The results on real search engine query traces and over 120 million Web pages show that after careful optimization such queries can be evaluated at a reasonable cost, while challenges remain for even larger collections and more general classes of ranking functions.

On the security of polling protocols in peer-to-peer systems###The peer-to-peer (P2P) network model differs from the well established client-server model in that all members of the network are assigned an equal role. P2P networks are recently gaining increasing popularity. Providing security in distributed content sharing in P2P networks is an important challenge. This paper identifies security vulnerabilities in the protocols for sharing servants' reputations in the Gnutella P2P system, proposed recently. It demonstrates attacks on the protocols that allow an attacker to alter the results of the voting procedure. The paper then presents a protocol that is resilient to the attacks described. In the proposed protocol, enhanced security against various attacks is achieved using smart design and a combination of various techniques such as the use of digital signatures for message integrity and random numbers for message freshness.

Information leak in the Chord lookup protocol###In peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, it is often essential that connected systems (nodes) relay messages which did not originate locally, on to the greater network. As a result, an intermediate node might be able to determine a large amount of information about the system, such as the querying tendencies of other nodes. This represents an inherent security issue in P2P networks. Therefore, we ask the following question: through the observation of the network traffic in a P2P network, what kind of information can an adversarial node learn about another node in the same network? We study this question in the case of a specific P2P system - Chord. We also study the effects of the parameters of Chord (such as finger-table size) and the various enhancements to Chord (such as location caching and data caching) on the amount of information leaked.
1334927
On the correctness of query results in XML P2P databases###In XML peer-to-peer (p2p) database systems, query results are usually assumed to be incomplete. Incompleteness issues derive from the unstable and open-ended nature of the network, where new nodes may connect at any time, and existing nodes may suddenly disappear. The incompleteness of input data used for query evaluation may also lead to the incorrectness of query results, which greatly affects the usefulness of the whole p2p approach to XML databases. We formally deal with the problem of result correctness in the presence of incomplete input data, and identify query classes for which the result correctness can be statically predicted at no extra cost w.r.t. usual syntactical and semantic query analysis.
1334926
Cache updates in a peer-to-peer network of mobile agents###In open multi-agent systems, agents need resources provided by other agents but they are not aware of which agents provide particular resources. We consider a peer-to-peer approach, in which each agent maintains a local cache with information about k resources, that is for each of the k resources, an agent that provides it. However, when an agent or a resource moves, cache entries become obsolete. We propose a suite of cache update policies that combine pull-based invalidation that is initiated by the agent that maintains the cache with push-based invalidation that is initiated by the agent that moves. We study and compare variations of oblivious flooding-based push/pull along with an informed push approach where each agent maintains a list of the agents that have it cached. Our experimental results indicate that a novel variation of flooding for push where a moving agent propagates its new location to agents in its old neighborhood achieves good cache consistency with a small message overhead. The proposed policies are suitable for any peer-to-peer system where peers cache information about other peers and this information becomes obsolete.

Percolation search in power law networks: making unstructured peer-to-peer networks scalable###We introduce a scalable searching protocol for locating and retrieving content in random networks with power-law (PL) and heavy-tailed degree distributions. The proposed algorithm is capable of finding any content in the network with probability one in time O(logN), with a total traffic that provably scales sub-linearly with the network size, N. Unlike other proposed solutions, there is no need to assume that the network has multiple copies of contents; the protocol finds all contents reliably, even if every node in the network starts with a unique content. The scaling behavior of the size of the giant connected component of a random graph with heavy tailed degree distributions under bond percolation is at the heart of our results. The percolation search algorithm can be directly applied to make unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, such as Gnutella, Limewire and other file-sharing systems (which naturally display heavy-tailed degree distributions and scale-free network structures), scalable. For example, simulations of the protocol on the limewire crawl number 5 network, consisting of over 65,000 links and 10,000 nodes, shows that even for this snapshot network, the traffic can be reduced by a factor of at least 100, and yet achieve a hit-rate greater than 90%.

Highways: proximity clustering for scalable peer-to-peer network###The "location-aware" construction of overlay networks requires the identification of nodes that are efficient with respect to network delay and available bandwidth. In this short paper, we propose Highways to create clusters of nodes using a novel "location-aware" method, based on a scalable and distributed network coordinate system. This helps to build overlay routing tables to achieve better proximity accuracy, thus, providing a mechanism to boost performance in application overlay routing.
1334959
Building adaptive peer-to-peer systems###Most peer-to-peer systems are built upon the assumption that their running environment is homogeneous. However, for Internet-scale applications this assumption could lead to performance limitations. We propose a framework for building peer-to-peer systems which use performance monitoring techniques to adapt to changes in their environment.

Reliable peer-to-peer end system multicasting through replication###A key challenge in peer-to-peer computing system is to provide decentralized and yet reliable services on top of a network of loosely coupled, weakly connected and possibly unreliable peers. This work presents an effective dynamic passive replication scheme designed to provide reliable multicast service in peer-cast, an efficient and self-configurable peer-to-peer end system multicast (ESM) system. We first describe the design of a distributed replication scheme, which enables reliable subscription and multicast dissemination of information in an environment of inherently unreliable peers. Then we present an analytical model to discuss its fault tolerance properties, and report a set of initial experiments, showing the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The different dimensions of dynamicity###In a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, a 'fabric' of overlay links helps peers discover and use other peers' resources. This fabric, however, is highly dynamic and constantly changing. While different measures of dynamicity have been implicitly and explicitly proposed, there is lack of deeper understanding about the various aspects of dynamicity. We systematically evaluate and quantify different dimensions of dynamicity through controlled generation of different dynamic networks. We also introduce a new dimension of dynamicity, persistence, which quantifies stable nodes in a network. This measure could be quite useful in the design and testing of P2P protocols that exploit the presence of stable nodes. Also, quite coincidentally, and to our surprise, a certain type of dynamic network that we designed has node degree properties that resemble those observed in social networks.

ICN: interest-based clustering network###An interest-based clustering peer-to-peer network (ICN) architecture is introduced in this paper. ICN uses a lot of Freenet mechanisms and is based on cache management. ICN is self-organizing, fully distributed, scalable, and logically hierarchical. In ICN, the upper level is bound by de Bruijn graph. Nodes in the lower level self-cluster based on interest. Through analysis and simulation, ICN shows good fault-tolerance, efficient data retrieval and resource usage as well as low overhead traffic.

Aggregating information in peer-to-peer systems for improved join and leave###We introduce the Distributed Approximative System Information Service (DASIS) as a useful scheme to aggregate approximative information on the state of a peer-to-peer system. We present how this service can be integrated into existing peer-to-peer systems, such as Kademlia and Chord. As a sample application, we show how DASIS can be employed for establishing an effective deterministic join algorithm. Through simulation, we demonstrate that the insertion of peers using DASIS information results in a well-balanced system. Moreover, our join algorithm gracefully resolves load imbalances in the system due to unfortunate biased leaves of peers.

A framework for testing distributed systems###Thorough testing of distributed systems, particularly peer-to-peer systems can prove difficult due to the problems inherent in deploying, controlling and monitoring many nodes simultaneously. This problem will only increase as the scale of distributed systems continues to grow. This framework implements a test bed environment using a semi-centralized peer-to-peer network as a substrate for sharing resources made available from standard PCs. This framework automates the process of test-case deployment using a combination of reflection and aspect oriented programming. This allows 'point-and-click' publishing of software onto the test-bed. Our framework also provides a common monitoring, control and logging interface for all nodes running on the network. Together, these features greatly reduce deployment-time for real-world test scenarios. Automated insertion and removal of test code also ensures that the testing process does not compromise the correctness of the final system.

P2P-4-DL: digital library over peer-to-peer###The P2P-4-DL project aims to investigate and build a DL system that would operate over a P2P structure. Rather than storing digital objects centrally they remain the responsibility of the individual peers that provide them. This allows the system to utilise network resources more efficiently as well as providing users with a greater sense of control over the digital objects they share. Our prototype also draws upon natural language processing (NLP) techniques in an attempt to increase the usability of the system. Other related work within this area includes EDUTELLA, a RDF based P2P infrastructure that can support the development of DL's.

Peer-to-peer security in mobile devices: a user perspective###Peer-to-peer networks are set to have a major impact on mobile devices after having created hopes, hypes, revolutions and disillusions in desktop applications. Mobile phones equipped with close range connectivity like Bluetooth and WLAN have already hit the market and they are the natural target to form ad hoc networks. New scenarios could attract the fantasy (and the pocket) of the end users, but at what cost in terms of personal privacy and security? This provocative paper will examine the security threats posed by peer-to-peer and ad hoc networks in mobile devices and the solutions designed to fight them from an end user perspective. We question the real need of those solutions compared with their performance overhead and annoyance and we make some observations and suggestions on how to make security a user-centric effort.

A framework for developing reflective and dynamic P2P networks (RaDP2P)###There has been a significant body of research conducted into various structured and unstructured overlay network protocols. Both paradigms have advantages for specific application domains and researchers are beginning to examine the benefits of using hybridized systems. We hypothesize that resource awareness and adaptation are essential to the efficient exploitation of the resources available on the diverse nodes which compose peer-to-peer networks. To support this, we propose a hybrid peer-to-peer model which uses an unstructured decentralised network layered on top of a structured overlay to provide support for multiple levels of adaptation.

SeAl: managing accesses and data in peer-to-peer sharing networks###We present SeAl, a novel data/resource and data-access management infrastructure designed for the purpose of addressing a key problem in P2P data sharing networks, namely the problem of wide-scale selfish peer behavior. Selfish behavior has been manifested and well documented and it is widely accepted that unless this is dealt with, the scalability, efficiency, and the usefulness of P2P sharing networks will be diminished. SeAl essentially consists of a monitoring/accounting subsystem, an auditing/verification subsystem, and incentive mechanisms. The monitoring subsystem facilitates the classification of peers into selfish/altruistic. The auditing/verification layer provides a shield against perjurer/slandering and colluding peers that may try to cheat the monitoring subsystem. The incentives mechanisms effectively utilize these layers so to increase the computational/networking and data resources that are available to the community. Our extensive performance results show that SeAl performs its tasks swiftly, while the overhead introduced by our accounting and auditing mechanisms in terms of response time, network, and storage overheads are very small.

Reputation management framework and its use as currency in large-scale peer-to-peer networks###We propose a reputation management framework for large-scale peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, wherein all nodes are assumed to behave selfishly. The proposed framework has several advantages. It enables a form of virtual currency, such that the reputation of nodes is a measure of their wealth. The framework is scalable and provides protection against attacks by malicious nodes. The above features are achieved by developing trusted communities of nodes whose members trust each other and cooperate to deal with the problem of nodes' selfishness and possible maliciousness.

Improving bandwidth efficiency of peer-to-peer storage###We broaden the applicability of peer-to-peer storage infrastructures to weakly-connected clients. We present a client-side technique that exploits the commonality between consecutive versions of a file to reduce the bandwidth required to store and retrieve files in a peer-to-peer storage infrastructure. We then present a novel data structure that allows us to use this technique in an environment where peers cannot be trusted to perform operations over unencrypted data. We have implemented the technique in the OceanStore prototype. Additionally, with simulations, we have demonstrated that the technique can reduce client-perceived latency of write and read operations by up to 80% compared to techniques used in current systems.

Erasure code replication revisited###Erasure coding is a technique for achieving high availability and reliability in storage and communication systems. We revisit the analysis of erasure code replication and point out some situations when whole-file replication is preferred. The switchover point (from preferring whole-file replication to erasure code replication) is studied, and characterized using asymptotic analysis. We also discuss the additional considerations in building erasure code replication systems.

"P2P scrabble. Can P2P games commence?"###The article considers the design of P2P games without trusted, centralized resources. The main difficulty is how to prevent the possibility of cheating. The article considers scrabble as a case study and attempts to solve issues such as maintenance of public, private, and concealed public state, as well as secret drawing from a finite set of objects. The issues of state replication are considered to allow node leaves. The article presents a fair protocol for secret drawing from a finite state that is resistant to node leaves.

Collaborative automated trust negotiation in peer-to-peer systems###The increasing popularity of peer-to-peer systems has promoted the development of new techniques to support various kinds of business transactions. However, users are reluctant to conduct high value transactions over P2P systems due to the inherent untrustworthiness of peers. In this paper, we investigate building trust through automated trust negotiation, which is orthogonal to existing reputation-based approaches. Trust negotiation makes it possible to prove a peer satisfies certain trust requirements imposed by the ongoing business. We also introduce locally trusted third parties, which we demonstrate can effectively promote successful trust negotiations in peer-to-peer systems.

PKI-based security for peer-to-peer information sharing###Freeflow of information is the feature that has made peer-to-peer information sharing applications popular. However, this very feature holds back the acceptance of these applications by the corporate and scientific communities. In these communities it is important to provide confidentiality and integrity of communication and to enforce access control to shared resources. We present a collection of security mechanisms that can be used to satisfy these security requirements. Our solutions are based on established and proven security techniques and we utilize existing technologies when possible. As a proof of concept, we have developed an information sharing system, called scishare, which integrates a number of these security mechanisms to provide a secure environment for information sharing. This system will allow a broader set of user communities to benefit from peer-to-peer information sharing.
1334931
Adaptive peer-to-peer topologies###We present a peer-level protocol for forming adaptive, self-organizing topologies for data-sharing P2P networks. This protocol is based on the idea that a peer should directly connect to those peers from which it is most likely to download satisfactory content. We show that the resulting topologies are more efficient than standard Gnutella topologies. Furthermore, we show that these adaptive topologies have the added benefits of increased resistance to certain types of attacks, intrinsic rewards for active peers and punishments for malicious peers and free riders.
1334932
Update propagation through replica chain in decentralized and unstructured P2P systems###We propose a novel algorithm, called update propagation through replica chain (UPTReC), to maintain file consistency in decentralized and unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. In UPTReC, each file has a logical replica chain composed of all replica peers (RPs) which are defined as peers that have replicas of the file. Each RP acquires partial knowledge of the bi-directional chain by keeping a list of information about k nearest RPs, called probe peers, in each direction. When an RP initiates an update, it pushes the update to all possible online (active) RPs through the replica chain. A reconnected RP pulls an online RP to synchronize the replica status and the information of the probe peers. An analytical model is derived to evaluate the performance of the UPTReC algorithm. The analytical results provide a better understanding of the system in choosing the system parameters for probabilistically guaranteed file consistency with minimum overheads. Simulation experiments are conducted to compare the performance with an existing update propagation algorithm based on the rumor spreading scheme. The experimental results show that the UPTReC can significantly reduce (up to 70%) overhead messages and also achieve smaller stale query ratio for files prone to frequent updates.

PeerStore: better performance by relaxing in peer-to-peer backup###Backup is cumbersome. To be effective, backups have to be made at regular intervals, forcing users to organize and store a growing collection of backup media. In this paper we propose a novel peer-to-peer backup system, PeerStore, that allows the user to store his backups on other people's computers instead. PeerStore is an adaptive, cost-effective system suitable for all types of networks ranging from LAN, WAN to large unstable networks like the Internet. The system consists of two layers: metadata layer and symmetric trading layer. Locating blocks and duplicate checking is accomplished by the metadata layer while the actual data distribution is done between pairs of peers after they have established a symmetric data trade. By decoupling the metadata management from data storage, the system offers a significant reduction of the maintenance cost and preserves fairness among peers. Results show that PeerStore has a reduced maintenance cost comparing to pStore. PeerStore also realizes fairness because of the symmetric nature of the trades.

Semantic-laden peer-to-peer service directory###The most intuitive way to build a service directory application that allows for service entities to register or search for services on top of a structured peer-to-peer network is to build reverse indices at appropriate nodes on the network. However, this implies trust on the reliability and integrity of other nodes on the network, which may be too risky an assumption for businesses. This paper proposes a service directory that groups service entities of the same category together; this is achieved by dedicating part of the node identifiers to correspond to their service category semantic. Using chord as the peer-to-peer substrate, this scheme logically divides the chord circle into equidistant arcs; each arc is called an island. This scheme results in the formation of islands of varying population, and thus changing the uniformly spread topology of the original chord. Simulations are used to investigate the path length and message load of the changed topology. An additional routing scheme is also proposed and simulated to exploit the new topology to gain better path length.

A distributed and measurement-based framework against free riding in peer-to-peer networks###We propose a distributed and measurement-based method to reduce the degree of free riding in P2P networks. We primarily focus on developing schemes to locate free riders and on determining policies that can be used to take actions against them. Our proposed schemes require each peer to monitor its neighboring peers, make decisions if they exhibit any kind of free riding, and take appropriate actions if required.

Latency model of a distributed hash table with big routing table###In peer-to-peer research, one of the most popular areas is distributed hash table (DHT). Among many topics in the DHT area, this paper focuses on DHT latencies, which are mainly caused by its basic multi-hop lookup function. Some DHTs already have the capability of building big routing tables to reduce hop counts. However, none of them are explicitly trying to enlarge the routing table and lower the hop count. This paper provides a simple latency model of DHT and discusses how big routing tables help reduce latency.

P2P applications using the semantic information oriented network###This paper describes P2P applications using an advanced P2P platform called SIONet. Based on its metadata-based routing and easy communication creation capabilities, various kinds of P2P applications can be constructed. Effective discovery, P2P content delivery with digital rights management, semi-active information exchanging community, and P2P ad hoc community are constructed. These are expected to be bases for next generation ubiquitous applications.

Semantic driven hashing (SDH): an ontology-based search scheme for the semantic aware network (SA Net)###The success of personalized resource discovery depends on its ability to allow users to discover, extract and integrate information of interest from heterogeneous sources, and its ability to provide these users with efficient tools to manipulate and convert the discovered information into knowledge. We propose semantic aware network (SA Net), a structured peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay architecture to support the basic functionalities of a personalized resource discovery. The SA Net uses an ontology-based representation of the resources to enable a semantic resource discovery and access that reflects the interest of the user. We describe the SA Net search scheme "semantic-driven hashing " (SDH), which uses lexical-based ontology to provide a foundation for indexing and search in structured P2P overlay infrastructure.

Constructing a balanced, (log(N)/1oglog(N))-diameter super-peer topology for scalable P2P systems###Current peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing applications are remarkably simple and robust, but their inefficiency can produce very high network loads. The use of super-peers has been proposed to improve the performance of unstructured P2P systems. These have the potential to approach the performance and scalability of structured systems, while retaining the benefits of unstructured P2P systems. There has, however, been little consensus on the best topology for connecting these super-peers, or how to construct the topology in a distributed, robust way. In this paper we propose a scalable unstructured P2P system (SUPS). The unique aspect of SUPS is a protocol for the distributed construction of a super-peer topology that has highly desirable performance characteristics. The protocol is inspired by the theory of random graphs. We describe the protocol, and demonstrate experimentally that it produces a balanced and low-diameter super-peer topology at low cost. We show that the method is very robust to super-peer failures and inconsistent information, and compare it with other approaches.
1334948
A robust protocol for building superpeer overlay topologies###The concept of superpeer has been introduced to improve the performance of popular file-sharing applications. A superpeer is a node in a P2P network that operates as a server for a set of clients, and as an equal w.r.t. other superpeers. By exploiting heterogeneity, the superpeer paradigm allows P2P networks to run more efficiently, without compromising their decentralized nature. This paper describes SG-1, a novel generic mechanism for the construction and the maintenance of overlay topologies based on superpeers. SG-1 is based on the well-known gossip paradigm, with nodes exchanging information with randomly selected peers and re-arranging the topology according to the requirements of the particular P2P application. The resulting protocol is extremely efficient and robust, capable to deal with a continuous flow of nodes joining and leaving the system, as well as to repair a network where up to 100% of the existing super-peers have been removed.

PROST: a programmable structured peer-to-peer overlay network###We present the idea of a programmable structured P2P architecture. Our proposed system allows the key-based routing infrastructure, which is common to all structured P2P overlays, to be shared by multiple applications. Furthermore, our architecture allows the dynamic and on-demand deployment of new applications and services on top of the shared routing layer.
1334964
Performance of Pastry in a heterogeneous system###We study how Pastry performs in a heterogeneous network environment of varying size. The large traffic overhead for management traffic makes the overlay nonfunctional if it grows too large. This can be circumvented by partitioning the routing tables at the cost of increased path lengths and response times.

P2P-based collaborative spam detection and filtering###Spam is one of the major problems of today email systems. While many solutions have been proposed to automatically detect and filter spam, spammers are getting more and more technically sophisticated and aware of internal workings of anti-spam systems, finding ways to disguise their emails to get around the different controls that can be enforced. We propose a decentralized privacy-preserving approach to spam filtering. Our solution exploits robust digests to identify messages that are a slight variation of one another and a structured peer-to-peer architecture between mail servers to collaboratively share knowledge about spam.

Broose: a practical distributed hashtable based on the de-Bruijn topology###Broose is a peer-to-peer protocol based on the de Bruijn topology allowing a distributed hashtable to be maintained in a loose manner. Each association is stored on k nodes to allow higher reliability with regard to node failures. Redundancy is also used when storing contacts avoiding complex topology maintenance for node departures and arrivals. It uses a constant size routing table of 0(k) contacts for allowing lookups in O(log N) message exchange (where N is the number of nodes participating). It can also be parameterized for obtaining O(log N / log log N) steps lookups with a routing table of size 0(k log N). These bounds hold with high probability. Moreover, the protocol allows load balancing of hotspots of requests for a given key as well as hotspots of key collisions. The goal is to obtain a protocol as practical as Kademlia based on the de Bruijn topology.

Cooperative pull-push cycle for searching a hybrid P2P network###Information acquisition is a great challenge in the context of a continually growing Web. Nowadays, large Web search engines are primarily designed to assist an information pull by the user. On this platform, only actual information needs are handled without assistance of long-term needs. To overcome these shortcomings we propose a cooperative system for information pull and push on a peer-to-peer architecture. We present a hybrid network for a collaborative search environment, based on a local personalization strategy on each peer, and a highly-available Web search service (e.g. Google). Each peer participates in the pull-push cycle, and has the function of an information consumer as well as an information provider. Hence, long-term information needs can be identified without any context restrictions, and recommendations are computed based on virtual knowledge communities.

Distributed search in P2P networks through secure-authenticated content management systems (CMSs)###Peer to peer (P2P) networks become more and more popular nowadays. They offer the capability of locating and obtaining a file from all over the world very fast. As a result, P2P networks constitute the main cause for the network traffic. Besides their many advantages, these networks suffer from a very strong drawback: authentication-security. Content management systems (CMSs) on the other hand offer this capability, among others. A combination of these two architectures could be obviously very interesting.

Analysis and application of passive peer influence on peer-to-peer inter-domain traffic###As a result of widespread of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing applications, it is a serious problem that inter-domain traffic between Internet service provider (ISP) networks increases. We present a novel inter-domain traffic flow model focusing on the presence of a passive peer, and proposes a new P2P traffic control method based on the model. This method uses a filter considering P2P flow characteristics and can be applied to the P2P networks whose protocol is closed. We also evaluate both validity and effectiveness of our proposals by performing more than 20 days experiments using real P2P network environment. The results prove that our model is reasonable enough and the proposed method is promising for decreasing inter-domain P2P traffic.
1334940
A placement scheme for peer-to-peer networks based on principles from geometry###Crucial for the performance of peer-to-peer networks based on geometric topologies is the measurement complexity and quality of the mapping function used to map a node in the network to a point in the geometric target space. In this paper we study how results from mathematics as well as data mining can be applied to this mapping problem. Using a metric space model for networks and results from mathematics a relation between the number of nodes to be mapped, the worst case error of the mapping and the dimension of the geometric target space is formulated. As a main result geometric cluster placement (GCP) is presented, an improved and resilient placement algorithm based on GNP. An evaluation of GCP presented is based on measurement data from the RIPE NCC test traffic measurement (TTM) project.

On de Bruijn routing in distributed hash tables: there and back again###We show in this paper that de Bruijn networks, despite providing efficient search while using constant routing table size, as well as simplicity of the understanding and implementation of such networks, are unsuitable where key distribution will be uneven, a realistic scenario for most practical applications. In presence of arbitrarily skewed data distribution, it has only recently been shown that some traditional P2P overlay networks with non-constant (typically logarithmic) instead of constant routing table size can meet conflicting objectives of storage load balancing as well as search efficiency. So this paper, while showing that de Bruijn networks fail to meet these dual objectives, opens up a more general problem for the research community as to whether P2P systems with constant routing table can at all achieve the conflicting objectives of retaining search efficiency as well as storage load balancing, while preserving key ordering (which leads to uneven key distribution).

From selfish nodes to cooperative networks - emergent link-based incentives in peer-to-peer networks###For peer-to-peer (P2P) systems to operate effectively peers need to cooperate for the benefit of the network as a whole. Most existing P2P systems assume cooperation, relying on peers to perform tasks that are of no direct individual benefit. However, when large open systems are deployed such assumptions no longer hold because by adapting selfishly nodes may become "freeloaders" leaching resources from the network. We present initial results from simulations of an algorithm allowing nodes to adapt selfishly yet maintaining high levels of cooperation in both a Prisoners' dilemma and a flood-fill query scenario. The algorithm does not require centralized or third party reputation systems, the monitoring of neighbor behavior or the explicit programming of incentives and operates in highly dynamic and noisy networks. The algorithm appears to emerge its own incentive structure.

Peer-to-peer spatial queries in sensor networks###Sensor networks, that consist of potentially several thousands of nodes each with sensing (heat, sound, light, magnetism, etc.) and wireless communication capabilities, provide great opportunities for monitoring spatial information about a region of interest. Although spatial query execution has been studied extensively in the context of database systems (e.g., indexing technologies), these solutions are not directly applicable in the context of sensor networks due to the decentralized nature of the sensor networks and the limited computational power and energy scarcity of individual sensor nodes. We present a peer-to-peer indexing structure, namely peer-tree, in order to address the problem of energy- and time-efficient execution of spatial queries (such as nearest-neighbor queries) in sensor networks. Loosely speaking, our peer-tree structure can be interpreted as a peer-to-peer version of the centralized R-tree index structure. Using the peer-tree as a building block, we present a peer-to-peer query processing model where a query can be posed in any node of the network without the need of a central server. For achieving minimal energy consumption and minimal response time, our query processing model ensures that only the relevant nodes for the correct execution of a query are involved in the query execution.

The deployment of cache servers in P2P networks for improved performance in content-delivery###The peer-to-peer (P2P) model generally requires that bidirectional and direct communications for content-delivery be set up between user peers after discovery of the desired content; however, firewalls and the currently popular NAT/NAPT (Network Address (Port) Translation) boxes prevent most end-users from freely participating in bidirectional communications. The preferred solution to this problem is to apply rendezvous points (RPs) as mediators in content-delivery. An RP is transparently accessible through firewalls to end-users. However, content delivery with the RP scheme takes ages, since there are two phases in the transfer-uploading from the holder-peer to the RP and downloading from the RP to a requestor-peer. We propose a way of improving performance in P2P content-delivery where an RP mediates among peers within firewalls. This is based on the deployment of cache servers, which are currently popular as a means for getting greater efficiency out of the Web. This solution provides the same performance in content-delivery as is seen in direct communication between user peers.

Search performance analysis in peer-to-peer networks###Recently peer-to-peer networks (P2P) have gained great attention and popularity. One key challenging aspect in P2P resource sharing environments is efficient searching algorithm. This is especially important for Gnutella-like decentralized and unstructured networks since they have power-law degree distributions. A robust search algorithm should respond to the query message promptly without generating redundant query messages. We present unified quantitative search performance measurements: query efficiency, search responsiveness, and search efficiency to objectively capture dynamic behaviors of various search algorithms from different perspectives. To gain insight of these search algorithms, we quantitatively characterize, through simulations, their search performance on different network topologies with different query/replication distributions.

AGnuS: the altruistic Gnutella server###The first generation of peer-to-peer file sharing systems followed the traditional client-server paradigm. However, legality and scalability issues have driven the development of decentralized file sharing protocols; the most popular of these being Gnutella. To date, such systems have been unable to match the quality of service (QoS) offered by centralized architectures. AGnuS improves QoS on Gnutella by increasing file availability, improving network friendliness and increasing file quality. This is achieved by layering caching, load balancing, content-based routing and filtering services on top of the core Gnutella protocol.

A distributed rendering environment for massive data on computational grids###Scientific visualization, especially for massive data sets, has emerged in different disciplines recently. Generally, distributed scientific visualization applications require multiple resources, e.g., high-end computing resources to process data, high speed network for data transfer and large size database for data storage. Furthermore, these applications will meet research challenges, e.g., heterogeneous resources, geographically distributed environment and considerable communication delay. We study an application of distributed massive data rendering. We present infrastructure of the distributed rendering environment and explain how grid technologies are used in this application. Dynamic pixel bucket partition (DPBP) algorithm is a new algorithm proposed for task allocation of distributed rendering application in computational grids. Experiments in real test ted shows the performance of DPBP algorithm and the framework.

Peer-to-peer wireless LAN consortia: economic modeling and architecture###We address the incentive issues that arise in a peer-to-peer WLAN consortium (P. Antoniadis et al., 2003).

Structuring peer-2-peer communities###Locating suitable resources within a peer-2-peer (P2P) system is a computationally intensive process, with no guarantee of quality and suitability of the discovered resources. An alternative approach is to categorise peers based on the services they provide, leading to the interaction between peers with common goals to form societies/communities. Organization of peers in different communities is suggested to be useful for efficient resource discovery. We analyse the types of communities that may be useful, and how they may be structured.

Adaptive probabilistic search for peer-to-peer networks###Peer-to-peer networks are gaining increasing attention from both the scientific and the large Internet user community. Popular applications utilizing this new technology offer many attractive features to a growing number of users. At the heart of such networks lies the search algorithm. Proposed methods either depend on the network-disastrous flooding and its variations or utilize various indices too expensive to maintain. We describe an adaptive, bandwidth-efficient algorithm for search in unstructured peer-to-peer networks, the adaptive probabilistic search method (APS). Our scheme utilizes feedback from previous searches to probabilistically guide future ones. It performs efficient object discovery while inducing zero overhead over dynamic network operations. Extensive simulation results show that APS achieves high success rates, increased number of discovered objects, very low bandwidth consumption and adaptation to changing topologies.
1231508
Scalable and continuous media streaming on peer-to-peer networks###With the growth of computing power and the proliferation of broadband access to the Internet, media streaming has widely diffused. Although the proxy caching technique is one method to accomplish effective media streaming, it cannot adapt to the variations of user locations and diverse user demands. By using the P2P communication architecture, media streaming can be expected to smoothly react to network conditions and changes in user demands for media-streams. We propose efficient methods to achieve continuous and scalable media streaming system. In our mechanisms, a media stream is divided into blocks for efficient use of network bandwidth and storage space. We propose two scalable search methods and two algorithms to determine an optimum provider peer from search results. Through several simulation experiments, we show that the FLS method can perform continuous media play-out while reducing the amount of search traffic to 1/6 compared with full flooding.
1231503
A game theoretic framework for incentives in P2P systems###Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are self-organizing, distributed systems, with no centralized authority or infrastructure. Because of the voluntary participation, the availability of resources in a P2P system can be highly variable and unpredictable. We use ideas from game theory to study the interaction of strategic and rational peers, and propose a differential service-based incentive scheme to improve the system's performance.
1231529
Applications of an advanced peer-to-peer platform###We describe actual and trial applications on the SIONet (semantic information-oriented network) peer-to-peer (P2P) platform developed by NTT Labs. SIONet is a logical overlay network. Peers record semantic information on SIONet routers (SI switches), which use the information to guide the routing of packets. We have already developed on-line community systems, a storage system, integrated database systems, components for a software development environment, and a simple game. We look at some of these applications.

An architecture for peer-to-peer economies###The MMAPPS project is researching the use of techniques from economics and social science to tackle some of the fundamental difficulties in creating well-founded, sustainable, P2P applications. The project's central approach is to extend market management techniques to improve cooperation between peers while enhancing the community-oriented structure of P2P architectures.
1231506
Dynamic networking refinement in distributed systems###Networking forms an essential part of distributed systems and reliable point-to-point communication is one of the main utilization of distributed networking systems. We discuss new techniques for improving networking in distributed systems under a sequence of operations, such as inserting and deleting a link between two nodes. As a result, by simply alternating the insertion and deletion of a link, we can generate a sequence of operations that at each step changes the number of components. It is shown how to rest at any time whether two nodes belong to the same sub-network, and how to insert and delete a link in O(m<sup>2</sup>3/) time in the worst case, where m is the current number of links in the network.
1231523
Token-based accounting and distributed pricing to introduce market mechanisms in a peer-to-peer file sharing scenario###We present a token-based accounting mechanism that alleviates the free riding problem in P2P networks. The approach is complemented by distributed pricing as a flexible and viable scheme to incite users to share valuable content and to efficiently balance requests among all peers based on economic decisions.

NanoPeer networks and P2P worlds###We present the NanoPeers architecture paradigm, a peer-to-peer network of lightweight devices, lacking all or most of the capabilities of their computer-world counterparts. We identify the problems arising when we apply current routing and searching methods to this nanoworld, and present some initial solutions, using a case study of a sensor network instance; Smart Dust. Furthermore, we propose the P2P Worlds framework as a hybrid P2P architecture paradigm, consisting of cooperating layers of P2P networks, populated by computing entities with escalating capabilities. Our position is that: (i) experience gained through research and experimentation in the field of P2P computing, can be indispensable when moving down the stair of computing capabilities, and that (ii) the proposed framework can be the basis of numerous real-world applications, opening up several challenging research problems.
1231505
Connectivity based node clustering in decentralized peer-to-peer networks###Connectivity based node clustering has wide ranging applications in decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) networks such as P2P file sharing systems, mobile ad-hoc networks, P2P sensor networks and so forth. We describe a connectivity-based distributed node clustering scheme (CDC). This scheme presents a scalable and an efficient solution for discovering connectivity based clusters in peer networks. In contrast to centralized graph clustering algorithms, the CDC scheme is completely decentralized and it only assumes the knowledge of neighbor nodes, instead of requiring a global knowledge of the network (graph) to be available. An important feature of the CDC scheme is its ability to cluster the entire network automatically or to discover clusters around a given set of nodes. We provide experimental evaluations of the CDC scheme, addressing its effectiveness in discovering good quality clusters. Our experiments show that utilizing message-based connectivity structure can considerably reduce the messaging cost, and provide better utilization of resources, which in turn improves the quality of service of the applications executing over decentralized peer-to-peer networks.

Share it! by bringing P2P into the tv-domain###Share it! is a European project with a focus on developing concepts and solutions for interconnecting digital TV set top boxes that enable users to share TV-programmes. One important goal of the project is to set future standards, e.g. in content management and rights management, for broadband connected digital television. We introduce the project objectives and the consortium, and then focus on how P2P technology and JXTA platform are used in solving various important issues that help to achieve the project goals.

The effectiveness of realistic replication strategies on quality of availability for peer-to-peer systems###We take an availability-centric view on quality of service (QoS) and propose a model and mechanisms for studying the effectiveness of realistic replication schemes on availability QoS for peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. We especially tackle the dynamic replica placement (RP) problem where our focus is on choosing dynamically the number and location of replicas while (1) meeting different availability QoS requirements for all individual peers and (2) taking the intermittent connectivity of peers explicitly into account. We model P2P systems as a dynamic stochastic graph in which the nodes go up and down depending on their assigned up probability. We develop some simple heuristic algorithms for solving the RP problem, which are fully distributed and adaptive. Through an event-driven simulation study we compare and evaluate the achieved availability QoS of the proposed RP algorithms. Simulation results show that (1) even simple heuristics can achieve reasonably high availability QoS, and (2) satisfying availability QoS requires more replicas than for only increasing the hit rate.

Grid security: lessons for peer-to-peer systems###The vision of the Grid is to provide a computational infrastructure supporting flexible, secure, coordinated resource sharing among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions, and resources. The Grid involves access to computer systems and data outside one's own company or institution. Security is therefore a major element in any Grid infrastructure, as it is necessary to ensure that only authorised access is permitted. The early development of the Grid also largely failed to take account of operational realities such as network administrator responsibilities and network devices such as firewalls. We believe that the peer-to-peer community is also likely to face similar conflicts between its decentralized management approach and the day-to-day concerns of those entrusted to maintain our security. We have found that it is necessary to develop a radical solution to some of these problems, including "proxy-free" delegation models and semantically-aware firewalls. The challenge for computer system developers and operators is to allow legitimate users to go about their business, while preventing unauthorised users from perpetrating these various types of abuse.

Role of P2P in complex disconnected networks: applications to mobile e-business and enterprise computing###With the tremendous advances in hand-held computing and communication capabilities, rapid proliferation of mobile computing environments, and decreasing device costs, we are seeing a growth in mobile e-business in various consumer and business markets. The trend is also picking up in large enterprises where dependency on mobile e-business environments has become routine for thousands of employees conducting daily business activities. For such a large collection of users, new reliable methods of search-find-obtain-transact (SPOT) have to be devised that are decentralized and self-managing. We present the grand challenges involved in designing and implementing reliable and transparent e-business applications in a decentralized and autonomous fashion that can handle business-critical applications in enterprises and virtual organizations. We present a novel architecture and framework for end-to-end mobile e-business applications based on concepts from P2P, dynamic socio-economic networks (overlays) and resource allocation from grid computing. The architecture takes into consideration disconnection, application context, synchronization, transactions and self-managing failure recovery modes to provide mobile users with seamless and transparent access to data and resources when needed. In addition, the mechanisms designed consider decentralized resource management for providing data availability and fast access. In our architecture, we consider a business process design based on state-machines and failure event management to handle disconnection, resource limitations and failures in open dynamic networks. We consider simple cost-based P2P networks as the underlying framework for connecting millions of mobile devices to thousands computational servers. A first-version of this system was designed, implemented and deployed a network of mobile clients using open Web-services standards.

Dynamic distributed overlay networking of IP multicast###Mastering of overlay networking is one of the fundamental challenges in the distributed computing and peer-to-peer arena. The IP (Internet protocol) is used to create a common overlay network on top of many existing networks using other transport protocols to suite their physical requirements. A technique known as tunneling, where the payload of an IP data packet carries another full IP packet including its header information, is an overlay networking method for creating a VPN (virtual private network) on top of the existing Internet or IP based network. A number of protocols are used on the Internet today are HTTP, SSL, TCP, UDP etc. Tunnels can be created using these protocols to passively enable overlay networking in the IP environment. An approach will be presented for generically creating IP multicast overlay networks in a fully distributed environment. This brings several advantages: a) nodes can be dynamically meshed together resulting in load balancing of the network traffic and the creation of a Web on top of the Web, b) multicast can now be communicated from any node to any multiple selection of neighboring nodes, c) in a distributed environment overlay networks can be constructed with no single point of failure, which is an important step towards fully fault tolerant distributed software infrastructure, d) the application developer is equipped with a communications middleware that permits the establishment of a true VPN without the need to configure additional network infrastructure, e) a turn-key solution for empowering the end-user to establish an overlay network without compromising the network administrator or service provider. The approach realized is applicable to broadband, narrowband, mobile and static environments. Finally some user case studies for applying this technology will be presented.

Enterprise strength security on a JXTA P2P network###Summary form only given. When one begins to think about security and P2P networks, and in particular, ad-hoc P2P networks with no real centralization, there are potentially billions of peer nodes, all possibly vulnerable to attack in a multitude of ways: Impersonation attacks and thus identity theft by unauthorized or falsely authorized parties; Invasion of privacy and all that that carries with it; Loss of data integrity; We imagine the equivalent of antimatter, a complete negation of the fundamental principles of security, or the antisecure net. Those among us with a strong interest in the secure net, and making P2P not only an accepted but preferred way of both doing business in the enterprise as well as protecting the personal privacy of the innocent users of P2P software require a toolbox with sockets, and a socket wrench that is capable of applying the torque that is appropriate to each scenario we wish to secure. It is easy enough for each peer node to be its own certificate authority, create its own root and service certificates, distribute the root certificate out-of-band or in some cases inband, different sockets for different scenarios, and then use transport layer security to insure two way authorization and privacy. Another socket that can be used by small communities of peers to assure that the public keys that they distribute can be trusted with some degree of certainty based on the reputation of the signers. Finally, without actually using a recognized CA, one can apply even more torque to tighten the security on a P2P network. Select one or more well protected and trusted systems, and give to them certificate-granting authority. These systems are unlike standard CAs in the sense that they are peers in the P2P Network. To acquire a certificate the peer must be authorized perhaps by using an LDAP directory with a recognized protected password. Here, the CA can also use a secure connection to a corporate LDAP service to authorize requesting peers. In the end, each of the above scenarios, each socket in our mythical toolbox, is a not so mythical. This is how Project JXTA approaches security, and what we will discuss in this keynote presentation.

Range addressable network: a P2P cache architecture for data ranges###Peer-to-peer computing paradigm is emerging as a scalable and robust model for sharing media objects. We propose an architecture and describe the associated algorithms and data structures to support the execution of range selection queries over data scattered across a P2P network especially for resource discovery in grid environments. We develop a distributed data structure referred to as a range addressable network that provides the following two quality-of-service guarantees: (i) the located peer is one with the smallest superset of the query range (important from the application perspective), and (ii) in a P2P network of n peers, a query is routed through O(log n) peers before the intended peer is found (important from the system perspective). Our preliminary experimental evaluation indicates that the range addressable network has desirable properties of scalability and load-balancing, which are crucial for the success of a large-scale P2P system.

Reducing maintenance overhead in DHT based peer-to-peer algorithms###DHT based peer-to-peer (P2P) algorithms are very promising for their efficient routing performance. However, most commercial P2P systems do not adapt DHT algorithms and still use central facilities or broadcasting based routing mechanisms. One reason impeding the DHT algorithm popularity is the routing information maintenance overhead in DHT algorithms; it generates considerable network traffic and increases P2P system complexity, especially in a highly dynamic environment. We discuss its effects on DHT routing performance and propose our solution to reduce this overhead.
1231534
Efficient, proximity-aware load balancing for structured P2P systems###Structured peer-to-peer (P2P) systems address the load balancing issue in a rather naive way, by simply resorting to the uniformity of the hash function utilized to generate object IDs. Such a random choice of object IDs could result in O(log N) load imbalance. We propose an efficient, proximity-aware load balancing algorithm for such systems. To our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize the proximity information to guide load balancing. In particular, our main contributions are: (1) A self-organized, fully distributed K-nary tree structure is constructed on top of a DHT for load balancing information collection/dissemination and load reassignment. (2) Load balancing is achieved by aligning those two skews in both load distribution and node capacity inhere in P2P systems - that is, have higher capacity nodes carry more loads. (3) Proximity information is utilized to guide load balancing such that virtual servers are assigned and transferred between physically close heavy nodes and light nodes, thereby minimizing the load transferring overhead and making load balancing fast and efficient.

3LS - a peer-to-peer network simulator###Peer-to-peer (p2p) networks are the latest addition to the already large distributed systems family. With a strong emphasis on self-organization, decentralization and autonomy of the participating nodes, p2p-networks tend to be more scalable, robust and adaptive than other forms of distributed systems. The much-publicized success of p2p-networks for file-sharing and cycle-sharing have resulted in an increased awareness and interest into the p2p protocols and applications. However, p2p-networks are difficult to study due to their size and the complex interdependencies between users, application, protocol and network. We present a 3-level simulator designed to study complex p2p networks.

Expeerience: a JXTA middleware for mobile ad-hoc networks###The combination of personal computing devices and wireless ad-hoc networks allows the concept of mobile ad-hoc information system, consisting of a highly dynamic, decentralized and self-organizing network of autonomous and mobile devices that interact as peers [M. Hannicainen et al. (2002), L. Kleinrock, (2000)]. Here we define a middleware layer, named Expeerience. We have decided to adopt as a basic software framework, an emerging P2P open technology such as JXTA. The second issue we address in this work is the integration of some code mobility support in the developed middleware to allow the distribution and execution of services on peers that originally do not own the service code. This has been introduced in our platform by adding a mobile code service, which enables to download and install new services dynamically only if necessary.

Efa: an efficient content routing algorithm in large peer-to-peer overlay networks###An important issue for peer-to-peer application is to locate content within the network. There are many existing solutions to this problem, however, each of them addresses different aspects and each has its deficiencies. We focus on the unstructured peer-to-peer scenario and present a constrained flooding routing algorithm, Efa, which overcomes some of the deficiencies of those existing strategies. Efa performs application level broadcasting in a potentially very large peer-to-peer network overlaid on the Internet. Efa is completely decentralized and self-organized. It is a more scalable alternative to flooding, which is commonly used in unstructured peer-to-peer systems. Utilizing just a small amount of topology info, Efa is almost as simple as flooding, but it is much more efficient and scalable.

Secure and resilient peer-to-peer e-mail design and implementation###E-mail is a mission-critical communication function for virtually all institutions. Modern e-mail employs a server-centric design, in which the user is critically dependent on her mail server. We present a peer-to-peer (P2P) email architecture that eliminates the need to rely on a single server and boosts the resilience of email against any kinds of attacks. Our architecture also provides confidential communications for all users. We present how the basic mechanisms of sending and reading email are implemented in our architecture. We also consider additional schemes to improve anonymity in our architecture. We present our prototype implementation and discuss the future of P2P communication architectures.

The costs of using JXTA###Project JXTA is an open-source effort to specify the standard protocols for peer-to-peer communication and collaboration. We propose a JXTA performance model and present results obtained by benchmarking the JXTA 1.0 reference implementation in Java. We focus on the performance evaluation of typical peer operations and consequences for the peer network, the user and the developer. The important trade-off between peer startup latency and the maintenance of the local cache is shown and discussed. The throughput limits of pipes, the core JXTA communication concept, are also measured in a LAN environment for smooth and bursty traffic. The results indicate that the limiting factor for reliable throughput is the number of messages rather than size in bytes, as well as that small JXTA messages carry an excessive overhead of control data. Important performance issues and trade-offs are identified and explored, as a basis for the formulation of guidelines for system designers and simulation-based research of JXTA networks.

A lightweight personal grid using a supernode network###Although grid computing has become popular in scientific research and the enterprise domain, there is no way a personal user who does not belong to any organization can construct or access the grid system for solving her problems. The main goal is to propose a lightweight personal grid that is self-organized without complicated configuration and infrastructural support like central servers and self-managed with the cooperation of participants. The key component of our system is the supernode network designed for autonomously and efficiently constructing the grid system. Based on the supernode network, our personal grid system forms a virtual organization (VO) with nodes having physical proximity. Therefore, communication latency between nodes in a VO can be minimized. Moreover, hierarchical scheduling is adopted using the two-level structure of the supernode network and new service architecture is proposed to improve the reusability of applications.

TrustMe: anonymous management of trust relationships in decentralized P2P systems###Decentralized peer to peer (P2P) networks offer both opportunities and threats. Its open and decentralized nature makes it extremely susceptible to malicious users spreading harmful content like viruses, trojans or, even just wasting valuable resources of the network. In order to minimize such threats, the use of community-based reputations as trust measurements is fast becoming a de-facto standard. The idea is to dynamically assign each peer a trust rating based on its performance in the network and store it at a suitable place. Any peer wishing to interact with another peer can make an informed decision based on such a rating. An important challenge in managing such trust relationships are to design a protocol to secure the placement and access of these trust ratings. Surprisingly, all the related work in this area either support very limited anonymity or assume anonymity to be an undesired feature and neglect it. We motivate the importance of anonymity, especially in such trust based systems. We then present TrustMe: a secure and anonymous underlying protocol for trust management. The protocol provides mutual anonymity for both the trust host and the trust querying peer. Through a series of simulation-based experiments, we show that the TrustMe protocol is extremely secure in the face of a variety of possible attacks and present a thorough analysis of the protocol.

Trust and reputation model in peer-to-peer networks###It is important to enable peers to represent and update their trust in other peers in open networks for sharing files, and especially services. We propose a Bayesian network-based trust model and a method for building reputation based on recommendations in peer-to-peer networks. Since trust is multifaceted, peers need to develop differentiated trust in different aspects of other peers' capability. The peer's needs are different in different situations. Depending on the situation, a peer may need to consider its trust in a specific aspect of another peer's capability or in multiple aspects. Bayesian networks provide a flexible method to present differentiated trust and combine different aspects of trust. The evaluation of the model using a simulation shows that the system where peers communicate their experiences (recommendations) outperforms the system where peers do not share recommendations with each other and that a differentiated trust adds to the performance in terms of percentage of successful interactions.
1231512
Establishing trust in distributed storage providers###Corporate IT as well as individuals show increasing interest in reliable outsourcing of storage infrastructure. Decentralized solutions with their resilience against partial outages are among the most attractive approaches. Irrespective of the form of the relationship, be it based on a contract or on the more flexible cooperative model, the problem of verifying whether someone promising to store one's data actually does so remains to be solved, especially in the presence of multiple replicas. We introduce a lightweight mechanism that allows the data originator or a dedicated verification agent to build up trust in the replica holder by means of protocols that do not require prior trust or key establishment. We show how naive versions of the protocol do not prevent cheating, and then strengthen it by adding means that make it economically attractive to be honest. This provides a foundation for further work in providing trustworthy distributed storage.
1231513
Identity crisis: anonymity vs reputation in P2P systems###The effectiveness of reputation systems for peer-to-peer resource-sharing networks is largely dependent on the reliability of the identities used by peers in the network. Much debate has centered around how closely one's pseudo-identity in the network should be tied to their real-world identity, and how that identity is protected from malicious spoofing. We investigate the cost in efficiency of two solutions to the identity problem for peer-to-peer reputation systems. Our results show that, using some simple mechanisms, reputation systems can provide a factor of 4 to 20 improvement in performance over no reputation system, depending on the identity model used.
1231510
Analysis on greedy-search based service location in P2P service grid###Service location based on greedy search is studied. A model is built to analyze the influence of the network topologies on this location method, and different network topologies are constructed to validate the model by way of simulation. The results show that, though the model assumes a uniform degree distribution, it agrees with the simulation result well if the average degree of the network is reasonably big. Hops and relative QoS index of the node found in a service location process are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the location method as well as the probability of locating the first 5% nodes with higher QoS level. Both model and simulation result show that the performance of greedy search based service location improves significantly with the increase of the average degree of the network. If changes of both topology and the QoS level of nodes can be ignored during a location process, it can be guaranteed that the location has high probability of finding the nodes with relatively high QoS level in small number of hops in a big service community. Model extension under arbitrary network degree distribution is further studied. A "two-phase" topology construction and service location based on greedy-search is also put forward.

Integrating semantics-based access mechanisms with P2P file systems###We present an architecture for a peer-to-peer (P2P) file system which supports semantics-based access. Central to this work is to provide semantic indexing and retrieval capabilities. Our semantic indexing and locating approach is based on distributed hash tables (DHTs) where the indices of semantically close files are clustered to the same peers with high probability (nearly 100%) by the use of locality sensitive hash functions. A query for finding semantically close files can be answered by consulting only a small number of peer nodes which are most responsible for such a query, instead of by query flooding. Our approach only adds index information to peer nodes, thus imposing only a small storage overhead. We constitute an initial step to integrate semantics-based access mechanisms into a P2P file system.

A transpositional redundant data update algorithm for growing server-less video streaming systems###Recently, a new server-less architecture is proposed for building low-cost yet scalable video streaming systems. In this architecture, video blocks are distributed among user hosts and these hosts cooperate to stream video blocks to one another. To improve reliability, data and capacity redundancy are introduced to sustain node failures. However, the data placement as well as the redundant data in the system will need to be updated whenever new nodes join the system. Results show that the redundancy update overhead is very significant and even exceeds that in data reorganization. We present a new Transpositional Redundant Data Update algorithm that takes advantage of the structure of Reed-Solomon Erasure Correction codes and employs a special encoding scheme to significantly reduce the redundancy update overhead, especially when updates are performed in batch.

The ubiquitous service-oriented network (USON)-an approach for a ubiquitous world based on P2P technology###As network technologies evolve in two areas-peer-to-peer technology and nomadic technology-new types of services provided through a ubiquitous environment will be created. To allow users to enjoy services in a ubiquitous environment, services that are appropriate to users' needs and desires must be created and discovered. In this paper, we describe the ubiquitous service-oriented network (USON). The USON is a network architecture for providing future networking services based on ubiquitous technologies. It is based on three technologies-service composition core technology, state-acquisition technology, and network reflective technology. Services provided through the USON will consist of autonomous distributed service elements (SEs). We describe the architecture, implementation, and an example of the USON, and explain how it will provide user services through a ubiquitous environment.

Transforming the reliability, security and scalability of IT communications through the pervasive deployment of serverless software infrastructure###The degree of user empowerment enabled by present day peer-to-peer applications in the areas of content-brokerage, super-distribution and group collaboration is now bringing IT professionals to an awareness of the many new and useful applications for "P2P" technology today. As a result, P2P technology and applications are beginning to take root throughout the industry as a whole. But these applications have only started to scratch the surface. The pervasive deployment of P2P technology in a truly serverless environment brings new opportunities and exciting challenges capable of completely transforming the way society experiences IT and media communications. This paper reviews how P2P technology can be applied pervasively to provide a serverless infrastructure that lowers the cost of wide-scale private networking right through from narrow-band networking at 2,400 bps to full broadband communications. The paper presents a three-part serverless infrastructure model, covering "application", "connectivity" and "management" and describes techniques for user discovery, auto-population and Quality of Service control applied at the end-user level. It describes a fault-tolerant approach to administrating large groups of users and network resources and discusses security at the transport, data storage and LAN levels. The paper also sets out a telecommunications carrier solution that enables service providers to further exploit their existing network infrastructure and presents a low cost solution for operators faced with high network configuration costs.

Intelligent software delivery using P2P###Internet has given software providers possibilities for electronic software distribution (ESD). At the same time bandwidth limitations lead to poor performance and scalability of the delivery process. The problem is even harder when delivering large, resource consuming software packages and media content. We propose an agent-based architectural model as a middleware for intelligent P2P electronic software delivery. We analyze the possibility of applying the peer-to-peer technology to the process of software delivery, relying on the experience and learned lessons of the related technologies. To this effect we analyze the available material on this topic and identify the important criteria that are crucial for the wide acceptance of ESD by both software providers and end-users. We argue that the proposed model can be used in building a system that meets most, if not all, of the identified criteria. The work presented opens a number of interesting research issues and investigation opportunities.

GISP: global information sharing protocol-a distributed index for peer-to-peer systems###This paper proposes GISP (global information sharing protocol), which aims at a world-wide distributed index. A distributed index consists of a set of pair data (key, value) shared by many peers. Each peer is responsible for a part of the index based on a hash function. Every peer is basically flat and there is no single point of failure. A distributed index is an essential building block for peer-to-peer systems. The design of GISP is simple, open, and easy to develop. GISP deals with peer heterogeneity and undesirable peers. Each peer promotes its strength so that stronger peers contribute more than weaker peers. Redundancy is important for defending against undesirable peers. Peers replicate pair data so that each pair data of the index is covered by several peers. There is a project at jxta.org for developing GISP. JXTA is a set of protocols for a peer-to-peer platform and provides a Java reference implementation. At the project, GISP is implemented in the Java language on JXTA. By building GISP on top of JXTA, a peer could reach a peer behind a firewall and even a peer in a different network transport. Jnushare is another project at jxta.org, which is to provide an application of GISP. Using Jnushare, people would share information such as files, messages and bookmarks.

A distributed search service for peer-to-peer file sharing in mobile applications###In this paper, we present the concept of passive distributed indexing, a general-purpose distributed search service for mobile file sharing applications, which is based on peer-to-peer technology. The service enables resource-effective searching for files distributed across mobile devices based on simple queries. Building blocks of PDI constitute local broadcast transmission of query- and response messages, together with caching of query results at every device participating in PDI. Based on these building blocks, the need for flooding the entire network with query messages can be eliminated for most application. In extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the performance of PDI. Because the requirements of a typical mobile file sharing application are not known-or even do not exist at all-we study the performance of PDI for different system environments and application requirements. We show that due to the flexible design PDI can be employed for several kinds of applications.

Coordinated learning to support resource management in computational grids###Managing resources in large scale distributed systems is an important concern for both peer-2-peer and computational grid systems, and is a complex and time sensitive process. Although existing peer-2-peer systems are divided into those that support computation (CPU) sharing or data sharing, users in a computational grid generally need to share both. Identifying which resources to select is important to guarantee reasonable execution time and cost to a given user or group of users. We provide first a description of a framework to support learning in the context a community of interacting peers, and show how this can be used to support resource sharing in computational grids.

Request algorithms in Freenet-style peer-to-peer systems###In most peer-to-peer systems, edge resources self-organize into overlay networks. At the core of Freenet-style peer-to-peer systems are insert and request algorithms that dynamically change the overlay network and replicate files on demand. We ran simulations to test how effective these algorithms are at improving the performance of subsequent queries. Our results show that for the original Freenet algorithms, performance improved less rapidly with a ratio of 99 requests to 1 insert than with an equal number of requests and inserts. This motivated us to design and test the performance of several new request algorithms. By changing the overlay network after failed requests and by further rewarding the fulfillers of successful requests, our new algorithms improved median pathlength by up to a factor of 9.25.

Scalable, efficient range queries for grid information services###Recent peer-to-peer (P2P) systems such as Tapestry, Chord or CAN act primarily as a distributed hash table (DHT). A DHT is a data structure for distributed storing of pairs (key, data) which allows fast locating of data when a key is given. To facilitate efficient queries on a range of keys, we propose a CAN-based extension of this DHT-functionality. The design of our extension suggests several range query strategies; their efficiency is investigated in the paper. A further goal is to enhance the routing aspects of current DHT-systems so that frequently changing data can also be handled efficiently. We show that relatively simple approaches are able to reduce the communication overhead in this case. The design of the system is driven by its application as a part of the information infrastructure for computational grids. Such grids provide an infrastructure for sharing computing resources; an information infrastructure is their inherent part which collects resource data and provides search functionality. Our approach complements current solutions such as MDS-2 by adding self-organization, fault-tolerance and an ability to efficiently handle dynamic attributes, such as server processing capacity. We evaluate our system in this context via a simulation and show that its design along with particular query and update strategies meet the goals of scalability, communication-efficiency and availability.

Building a P2P forum system with JXTA###Decentralized file-sharing systems like Napster and Gnutella have popularized the peer-to-peer approach, which emphasizes the use of distributed resources in a decentralized manner. Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are a relatively new addition to the large area of distributed systems. Their emphasis on sharing distributed resources, self-organization and use of discovery mechanisms sets them apart from other forms of distributed computing. Avoiding centralized components, and extensive resource/service sharing allows P2P systems to outperform other forms of distributed systems with regards to scalability and robustness due to load distribution and the avoidance of bottlenecks and single points of failure. This paper has two aims; firstly to report on the use of JXTA in converting a server-centric legacy forum system into a P2P system. It also attempts to encourage others in redesigning existing client-server systems into P2P applications as a way of to better understand and evaluate the costs and benefits of this technology.

The multi-ring topology-high-performance group communication in peer-to-peer networks###Emerging peer-to-peer applications require efficient group communication. However, current techniques for group communication are not optimal for peer-to-peer networks, which do not have group communication methods themselves. This paper presents the novel multiring topology, which is designed to meet requirements of high performance group communication in peer-to-peer networks. It improves data communication by applying several concepts: building overlay networks for each topic, a topology consisting of multiple rings, backup links and dual mode links. Experimental results provide evidence for improving performance and scalability of peer group communication.

eComP: an architecture that supports P2P networking among ubiquitous computing devices###In the new paradigm of computer use, the computer ceases to exist as an integrated multi-task device, but disintegrates into a task-oriented collection of networked devices. These devices do not resemble computers yet they have computational abilities. None of these concepts will be realised without appropriate support from communication technologies-P2P networking being the primary candidate. This paper describes part of the research being conducted in the Extrovert Gadgets project geared towards applying P2P computing solutions to the context of networked everyday objects.

Integrating peer-to-peer networking and computing in the AgentScape framework###The combination of peer-to-peer networking and agent-based computing seems to be a perfect match. Agents are cooperative and communication oriented, while peer-to-peer networks typically support distributed systems in which all nodes have equal roles and responsibilities. AgentScape is a framework designed to support large-scale multi-agent systems. Pole extends this framework with peer-to-peer computing. This combination facilitates the development and deployment of new agent-based peer-to-peer applications and services.

A scalable and ontology-based P2P infrastructure for Semantic Web Services###Semantic Web Services are a promising combination of Semantic Web and Web service technology, aiming at providing means of automatically executing, discovering and composing semantically marked-up Web services. We envision peer-to-peer networks which allow for carrying out searches in real-time on permanently reconfiguring networks to be an ideal infrastructure for deploying a network of Semantic Web Service providers. However, P2P networks evolving in an unorganized manner suffer from serious scalability problems, limiting the number of nodes in the network, creating network overload and pushing search times to unacceptable limits. We address these problems by imposing a deterministic shape on P2P networks: We propose a graph topology which allows for very efficient broadcast and search, and we provide an efficient topology construction and maintenance algorithm which, crucial to symmetric peer-to-peer networks, does neither require a central server nor super nodes in the network. We show how our scheme can be made even more efficient by using a globally known ontology to determine the organization of peers in the graph topology, allowing for efficient concept-based search.

Using P2P techniques for content distribution internetworking: a research proposal###In this paper we discuss the use of algorithms and techniques, currently deployed in peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, in the design of content distribution internetworks (CDIs). Specifically, we propose a CDI design approach that addresses issues of request routing, content delivery, and replication, based on P2P techniques.

Dependability properties of P2P architectures###This paper aims to identify the main dependability properties (and related properties) that can play a part within P2P systems. This, in turn, can be used to help inform the creation of more dependable systems. Given the influence the choice of architecture can have, this paper first provides an overview of the main P2P architectures, before going on to identifying the different properties. Future work will provide a detailed analysis of the effect the architectures can have on these properties.

Grid computing in the enterprise with the UD MetaProcessor###The computing needs of enterprises are typically met by purchasing or using existing dedicated high-performance compute resources. An alternative, proposed in this presentation, is to meet these computing needs by harnessing under-utilized resources across the enterprise. This represents a form of grid computing in the enterprise that is extremely cost-effective and substantially improves the return on investment in existing compute resources. The primary source of under-utilized resources are PCs and, in the aggregate, represent a dominant source of compute power. The UD MetaProcessor software represents these resources as a single large grid service for administrators, application developers and users. I present some of the challenges with this grid service together with some of the solutions to these challenges. A number of case studies will show the immediate benefits of adopting this technology to satisfy computational needs today. The sheer amount of compute power available also enables feasible solutions to problems that were previously discarded as being impractical or impossible to solve.

Multishelf: an experiment in peer-to-peer infomediation###We describe the architecture and the implementation of Multishelf-a decentralized peer-to-peer infomediator. Multishelf was designed and built during a ten-week senior software methodology course using the Proem peer-to-peer platform. We discuss the infomediation problem, present our scalable peer-to-peer solution including the effectiveness of using the Proem peer-to-peer platform, and conclude with plans for future work.

Why peer-to-peer (P2P) does scale: an analysis of P2P traffic patterns###Recently peer-to-peer (P2P) configurations have found considerable interest in the Internet community. At the same time P2P has often been criticized for poor scaling behavior. We analyze P2P signaling traffic, both via analytic estimates and via computer simulation. With the help of two probabilistic approaches, we can derive an upper as well as a lower bound for the growth of P2P-signaling traffic, according to a pure peer-to-peer protocol as given e.g. in the Gnutella protocol. With the help of a simulation we are able to verify our mathematical derivations. As a result it appears, that P2P actually scales much better than predicted by more conventional theory relying on simplifying assumptions, and thus exponential growth of the messaging load in pure peer-to-peer networks must not be assumed.

Market structures in peer computation sharing###A number of systems exist for harnessing the power of idle workstations and home computers, but these only make that power available for central projects. Making the power of these systems available to home users could be achieved with a peer-to-peer architecture. An unregulated peer computation sharing system has the potential for abuse by free riders. In order to encourage contribution to the system, a free market model would allow users to 'bank' contributed computing power with other peers, for redemption at a later time. This paper has two aims. Firstly provides an overview on existing peer-to-peer computing models. Secondly it is an investigation into the existing market models and their usability in a compute-sharing P2P system.

Evolving the ASP business model: Web service provision in the Grid era###Both practitioners and academics in the information technology field are becoming increasingly familiar with the term application service provision (ASP). Predictions for growth in the ASP global market in 2003 are estimated to range from $5 billion (IDC) to $35 billion (Qwest) (Kluge, 2002). If the predicted growth is realised, ASPs will have a significant impact on IS (Information Systems) strategies and outsourcing practice, not only for large companies, but also for the under-exploited SME (small or medium enterprise) sector. This potential is attracting many companies that aspire to become ASPs, but as some early ASPs began to fail, many companies tried to distance themselves from this term (Campos, 2002). With the emergence of the Open Grid Service Architecture and Globus Toolkit as incubators for evolving an ASP business model to maintain profitability, this paper proposes a hypothetical Grid Service Provision model. ASPS' evolution paths can be defined by service delivery and infrastructure axes. In the service delivery axis, the paper presents software application delivery moving from a pre-packaged one-to-many model to the interoperable Web service model. In the infrastructure axis, the paper demonstrates the evolving path from HTTP-IP based networking to OGSA grid computing. This paper proposes a new hypothetical model of software and service delivery that is accompanied by two case studies and comparisons.

Rhubarb: a tool for developing scalable and secure peer-to-peer applications###Rhubarb is a platform for building peer-to-peer (P2P) applications. Rhubarb offers an API similar to Berkeley sockets. Using Rhubarb, P2P applications can be developed that are independent of centralized resources and the DNS system. Rhubarb organizes nodes in a virtual network, allowing connections across firewalls/NAT, and efficient broadcasting. The virtual network is scalable due to a hierarchical organization and efficient state management. Rhubarb is securely protected against outside and inside attacks.

A semantical and implementative comparison of file sharing peer-to-peer applications###In this paper some representative peer-to-peer file sharing applications are compared against two sets of features. The first set describes the semantics of the relevant primitive operations over the shared data space. The second set describes the algorithmic and architectural solutions to implement these primitives. The obtained classification points out the mutual relationships between the expressive power and the degree of abstraction over low-level issues offered by each application.

Adaptability in component-based peer-to-peer applications###One great challenge in the field of software engineering is to develop reusable, adaptable and scalable software systems. To address this goal, a multiplicity of approaches have been proposed. We present our work towards the realisation of a component model as well as of an architecture serving as a runtime environment for component-based, distributed peer-to-peer applications. We further explain additional concepts for adaptability in peer-to-peer applications.

Advanced peer-to-peer network platform for various services-SIONet (Semantic Information Oriented Network)###This paper describes an advanced peer-to-peer (P2P) platform called the Semantic Information Oriented Network (SIONet). This is a meta-network that delivers user events based on semantic information (meta-data) and searches for specific entities dynamically in the network. SIONet consists of Semantic Information (SI) Switch (SI-SW), which compares the meta-data of each event with the receiver's conditions, SI-Router (SI-R), which routes events between two SI-SWs, Event Place (EP), which is a logical subnet constructed by SI-SW and SI-R, and SI-Gateway (SI-GW), which connects EPs. These elements are self-organizing as needed, making possible a secure and scalable P2P network.

Towards a hierarchical, semantic peer-to-peer topology###We propose a new P2P network topology that reduces bandwidth consumption and provides complete searches by employing a tree hierarchy of indexing nodes that facilitates the search functionality. Each node consists of a cluster of peers to provide fault tolerance and scalability.

NetProber: a component for enhancing efficiency of overlay networks in P2P systems###The peer-to-peer (P2P) computing paradigm is an emerging paradigm that aims to overcome most of the main limitations of the traditional client/server architecture. In the P2P setting, individual computers communicate directly with each other in order to share information and resources without relying on any kind of centralized server. To achieve this full decentralization, an application-level (or overlay) network is constructed using, for example, TCP connections. In most of the existing P2P systems, the overlay network is built in a manner that does not guarantee that the overlay network is efficient with respect to a given metric (e.g. latency, hop count and bandwidth). Hence, an overlay node can be very far away, in terms of a given metric, from its overlay neighbors. This can result in both, an inefficient routing at the overlay network and an ineffective use of the underlying IP network. In this paper, we introduce a new measure, "goodness of overlay networks", to quantify the quality of an overlay network for a given metric. We then propose NetProber, a simple, distributed and scalable component that can be combined with any connected overlay network in order to allow the latter to adapt, and to become "good" within a finite amount of time.

Peer-to-peer mobile network architecture###An individuals ultimate independence from unwanted ownership and control can be obtained in a Mobile Peer to Peer (MP2P) environment. This paper takes a historical view on the subject of mobile networks and underscores some of the main architectural principles enabling MP2P. The concept of local policy enforcement is introduced as a mental tool to define terminal centric control, as opposed to network centric control. This concept is further expanded to incorporate a mobile architecture including a ubiquitous end user device, where business model related policies are stored. In this way, the architecture becomes business model independent, and business model related policies stored separately in a terminal based policy repository reflect any relationship that the individual has engaged into. This includes Personal Area Networks and AD-HOC networks as well. Another such relationship can be a P2P relationship, which can be combined with another relationship concerned with mobility

Technologies for sharing and collaborating on the Net###This paper is an overview of the technologies that are needed for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing. It represent a high level overview of material covered in much greater detail in Barkai, (2001). P2P means different things to different people, and we start by defining P2P and categorizing applications that use P2P. Server-mediated P2P is included as a legitimate P2P architecture. The applications space is divided into three types: distributing computing, content sharing, and collaboration. After a discussion of what is required from an infrastructure for P2P we describe some solutions that address a class of applications each, but also include a start towards a general-purpose architecture. The same basic services are needed by each platform and application, and all will benefit from common middleware. This is one way, though not the only one, to achieve interoperability - that will be useful to users and application developers; in particular, when we reach the integrated applications stage. Regardless of how the infrastructure is constructed, the technical topics which need to be addressed are the same: communication through gateways and firewalls; naming and discovery of peers and resources when DNS is not enough; availability and persistence of resources in spite of intermittent connectivity and dynamic presence; security in a distrustful environment and locally managed systems; and, management of distributed resources in a heterogeneous setting. There are a number of interesting ways in which people have applied P2P technologies. We give an example in each of the three application categories. The final segment of the talk summarizes the challenges that need to be overcome if P2P is to be widely adopted. The major technical challenges are direct communication, security, naming and interoperability. There are also social and cultural barriers. These are the result of decentralization, and loss of direct control over resources. They also have to do with trust, reputation, and online communities. Nonetheless, there are some promising activities around the industry-working groups and initiatives, and a great opportunity

Towards a content-based aggregation network###We present an architecture for content-based aggregation in peer-to-peer filesharing networks. It is designed to significantly reduce the amount of nodes that have to be queried, by introducing a distributed index into the system. This index allows content to be located in a peer-to-peer network without using broadcast-style techniques. We also show how this index can be created and maintained in a decentralized self-organizing fashion

An initial approach of a scalable multicast-based pure peer-to-peer system###There are always big question marks when implementing the pure peer-to-peer architecture. Our research is a short-term initiative to investigate the evolution of future architecture for pure peer-to-peer. Our first implementation is an infrastructure that supports a large number of Internet users by implementing IP multicast technology into the pure peer-to-peer architecture. The prototype of our approach is known as Purep2p. We outline the actual implementation of Purep2p and discuss the proposed architecture with particular emphasis on IP multicast technology. Our design is independent of any central server and interoperable on any platform to communicate between each other

Peering the smart homes###The concepts of Smart Home, Connected Home, Home Networking or Home Communication are quite well known through the media. This interest toward home automation and control leads to a new view for the future home, a new life style, with new services and applications. This paper points out the key features of P2P technology that can boost the optimization of home automation. With this technology in place we find new benefits emerging for both households and real estate companies. Research directions for future work are also suggested

A definition of peer-to-peer networking for the classification of peer-to-peer architectures and applications###This paper offers a definition for peer-to-peer networking and makes the differences to common so called client server-architectures clear. With this definition we are able to classifiy currently existing networking concepts in the Internet either as "pure" peer-to-peer, or "hybrid" peer-to-peer or client server architecture

Peer-to-peer streaming media delivery###Whatever definitions have been put upon it, peer-to-peer is an effective rallying cry for a new way of doing things. Streaming media delivery is particularly susceptible to a peer-to-peer architectural approach. Peer-to-peer systems have been shown to reduce the bandwidth cost and increase the scalability of on-demand and streaming content on the Internet. Similar techniques can be used to create a "virtual multicast", an application-layer implementation of the efficient subnet broadcast features of network-layer multicasting

Getting the most from accountability in P2P###An important concern for P2P (peer-to-peer) developers is accountability. The few sources on P2P accountability define the term as a mechanism that makes the users accountable for their activity in the network. This general definition requires some refining to render it useful in the development of a P2P implementation. By 'accountability' we denote three general functions for the system: one is the system ability to detect and log any activity inside the system for future reference; two is the system ability to convert this logged data into statistical information; and three is the response generated from this statistical information. Thus we have three foundational functions on which accountability is based. This paper suggests a low-overhead accountability scheme for content sharing

Breaking the server and data communications barrier with serverless guaranteed quality of service (GQoS) compliant communications###Imagine receiving a new software application that can be installed on any device enabling the secure, simultaneous exchange and distribution of media files, unrestricted by type, volume and number of users. All you need is a Java-enabled device and a network connection. There is no server, so there is no need to install any additional infrastructure. In this serverless world, conducting a telephone or videoconference with multiple parties is as easy as sending an E-mail or calling a friend. You can manage your connection to your colleagues, wherever you are, from a PC or a handheld wireless device. You can connect to other group members or redirect large documents to your desktop PC or any other connected device. You can now move documents and media rich content to any user or group of users securely without the need of a server, and receive confirmation of receipt from each user. In effect what you have here is a "Personal Communications Center" that gives you the equivalent of a personal, limitless express courier and conferencing service. This concept of Personal Business Communications is no longer a futuristic dream. Quick Com is making it reality. Peer-to-Peer technologies are poised to remove the service, delivery and quality limitations of the present day information exchange system, and to bring high quality, professional communications standards to the world of Internet-based networks at a fraction of the cost. In this paper we will review the concepts of Networks, Data Delivery, and Architectures. We will examine why Quality of Service is essential in Peer-to-Peer exchange, distribution and communications for business communities. In closing, this paper will highlight the competitive, survival advantage of serverless and Peer-to-Peer communities

Peer-to-peer architecture case study: Gnutella network###Despite recent excitement generated by the P2P paradigm and despite surprisingly fast deployment of some P2P applications, there are few quantitative evaluations of P2P system behavior. Due to its open architecture and achieved scale, Gnutella is an interesting P2P architecture case study. Gnutella, like most other P2P applications, builds at the application level a virtual network with its own routing mechanisms. The topology of this overlay network and the routing mechanisms used have a significant influence on application properties such as performance, reliability, and scalability. We built a 'crawler' to extract the topology of Gnutella's application level network, we analyze the topology graph and evaluate generated network traffic. We find that although Gnutella is not a pure power-law network, its current configuration has the benefits and drawbacks of a power-law structure. These findings lead us to propose changes to the Gnutella protocol and implementations that bring significant performance and scalability improvements

Introduction to Gnougat###Gnougat is an experimental system for the distribution of static file content using a fully decentralised peer-to-peer network on the Internet. The basic premise for the system is that a content-centred approach using hash keys to uniquely identify portions of files called chunks will provide more flexibility to each node in the system to act to benefit the system

Search in JXTA and other distributed networks###The goal of this paper is to review and classify the different approaches to search in peer-to-peer networks. We then describe the approach implemented in JXTA search. JXTA is an open peer-to-peer network environment. JXTA search is a network of hubs that index the content of a peer-topeer network. Finally, we propose an organization of the JXTA search hubs, which reduces the storage and communication requirements between the hubs

An XML-based middleware for peer-to-peer computing###An increasing number of distributed applications will be written for mobile hosts, such as laptop computers, third generation mobile phones, personal digital assistants, watches and the like, with focus on peer-to-peer collaboration. Application engineers have to deal with a new set of problems caused by mobility, such as low bandwidth, context changes or loss of connectivity. During disconnection, independently from each others, users will typically update local replicas of shared data, possibly generated by peers. The resulting inconsistent replicas need to be reconciled upon re-connection. To support building mobile applications that use both replication and reconciliation over ad-hoc networks, we have designed XMIDDLE, a peer-to-peer middleware that targets mobile computing settings. In this paper we describe XMIDDLE and show how reflection capabilities are used to allow application engineers to influence replication and reconciliation techniques. XMIDDLE enables the transparent sharing of XML documents across heterogeneous mobile peers, allowing online and off-line access to data

When peer-to-peer comes face-to-face: collaborative peer-to-peer computing in mobile ad-hoc networks###This paper motivates and describes the notion of mobile ad-hoc information systems. Such a system consists of a decentralized and self-organizing network of autonomous, mobile devices that interact as peers. Connectivity is determined by distance between devices; as hosts change their physical location they establish pair-wise communication links based on mutual proximity. We describe application scenarios for mobile ad-hoc information systems and identify technical challenges of a generic software infrastructure. Moreover, we present the goals and architecture of Proem, a peer-to-peer system and development platform for mobile ad-hoc applications. Proem has successfully been used as instructional tool in an advanced software engineering course on peer-to-peer computing
